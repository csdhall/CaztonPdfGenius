A number of issues impact the quality of these\\nmodels, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs;\\nsmall scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous\\nevaluation resulting in overestimating the small model’s capability as they\\ntend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs . To\\naddress these challenges, we develop Orca, a 13-billion parameter model\\nthat learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from\\nrich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought\\nprocesses; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from\\nChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and\\ndiverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses\\nconventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B\\nby more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-\\nBench Hard (BBH) and 42%on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity\\nwith ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance\\n(4pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic\\nexaminations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot\\nsettings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4. Our research indicates\\nthat learning from step-by-step explanations, whether these are generated\\nby humans or more advanced AI models, is a promising direction to improve\\nmodel capabilities and skills.\\n∗Co-primary authors.

Topical performances shown in Figure 11.\\nLarge Foundation Models (LFMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 [ 2] exhibit remarkable zero-\\nshot performances across a broad spectrum of tasks. Alongside academic benchmarks like\\nHuman Eval [ 3] and Big Bench [ 4], GPT-4 has also demonstrated human-level performance\\non various professional exams, including the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and USMLE. These\\nadvancements can be credited to the scaling of both model and dataset sizes, as well\\nas the incorporation of a second layer of training to better align the models with user\\nintent. This alignment is accomplished by fine-tuning the models via supervised learning on\\ndemonstrations of prompts and desired model behavior, and through reinforcement learning\\nfrom human preferences [5].\\nAs these models continue to evolve and become more powerful, an intriguing question arises:\\nCan we use the model itself to supervise its own behavior or that of other AI models? Bai\\net al.[6]have shown that by sampling output from an initial model, generating revisions,\\nand then fine-tuning the original model based on these revised responses, model behavior\\ncan be controlled more effectively and can be made more harmless, with significantly fewer\\nhuman labels.\\nRecently, there has been an influx of studies using LFMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 as\\nteachers to generate large datasets, for instruction tuning , and to train smaller models,\\nsuch as Alpaca [ 7], WizardLM [ 8] and Vicuna [ 9]. While these models can produce content\\nthat matches the style of their teachers, they often fall short in terms of the reasoning and\\ncomprehension skills displayed by the larger foundation models.\\n423.348.9 49.7\\n0102030405060\\nVicuna-13B ChatGPT Orca-13BAggregate Accuracy (%)BigBench -Hard (Zero -shot, MCQ)Figure 3: For complex zero-shot reasoning tasks in BigBench-Hard, Orca achieves parity\\nwith ChatGPT (without any exemplar or CoT) with task performances shown in Figure 12.\\nTake, for example, the 13-billion parameter instruction-tuned model, Vicuna [ 9] (with\\nLLAMA-13B [ 10] as the base), which is widely regarded as one of the best models in its\\nfamily, as evidenced by its performance on leaderboards like OpenLLM3and ChatArena4.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the widely-used evaluation method of using GPT-4 as the judge\\nsuggests that Vicuna retains 92%of ChatGPT’s quality. However, a more meticulous\\nevaluation on reasoning benchmarks against human labels finds Vicuna to retain only 64%\\nof ChatGPT’s quality on professional and academic exams (see Figure 2), and only 48%of\\nChatGPT’s quality on complex benchmarks like BigBench-hard [ 11] (see Figure 3)5. This\\ndiscrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller\\nLLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\\nIn essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust\\nreasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose\\nstrategies for addressing them.\\n1.1 Challenges with Existing Methods\\nCurrent research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM’s like ChatGPT exhibits\\nnotable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations\\nare corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al. [12], where the authors assert that\\n“model imitation is a false promise” since “broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation\\nwould require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more\\ndiverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.”. Contrary to this\\nassertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is\\npossible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM’s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that\\nrequire sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\\nSimple instructions with limited diversity. The Self-Instruct [ 13] process involves using\\nan initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or\\noverly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated\\ninto the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through\\nSelf-Instruct, such as “what are the three primary colors?\", “what is the capital of France?\", etc. ,\\ncan exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [ 7] and WizardLM [ 8]\\nemploy a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which\\ngradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to\\novercome some of the method’s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works\\nlike Vicuna [ 9] and Koala [ 14] demonstrate remarkable performance due to more human-like\\nconversations and natural instructions in community-contributed conversations like those in\\nShareGPT6that provided a forum for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT.\\nTask diversity and data scaling. Human-contributed conversations in ShareGPT are a\\nvaluable source of data, but they also have some limitations. They tend to favor creative\\n3https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\\n4https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena\\n5ChatGPT may have data contamination issues with respect to BigBench\\n6https://sharegpt.com/\\n5content generation and information-seeking queries over other types of tasks. Therefore,\\nmodels trained on such natural conversations may capture the style but not the reasoning\\nprocess of the LFMs – demonstrated in the performance of Vicuna in Figures 2 and 3.\\nAdditionally, such mode of data collection is also limited in scale. Table 1 shows an overview\\nof the size of data and tuning methods employed in recent popular instruction tuning works.\\nLimited imitation signals. Existing methods rely on immitation learning from\\n⟨query, response⟩pairs generated by the teacher model. However, this provides limited\\nsignals to trace the reasoning process of the teacher. Prior works [ 15,16] on open-box model\\nshow that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can\\nsignificantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box\\nLFM’s7, recent work [ 17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close\\nthe gap for task-specific distillation.\\nEvaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely\\nlimited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking\\nit to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system\\n1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, this approach has\\nseveral drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g., 80instructions in Vicuna and 218\\ninstructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [ 18]. For example, we notice\\nthat models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts\\nthat GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate\\nresponses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of\\nsmaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and\\nreasoning skills.\\n1.2 Key Contributions\\nIn this research, our focus is on addressing the challenges mentioned above, specifically with:\\nExplanation tuning: We augment⟨query, response⟩pairs with detailed responses from\\nGPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These\\nprovide the student with additional signals for learning. We leverage system instructions (e.g..,\\nexplain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response , etc.) to\\nelicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the\\nprompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the\\nLFM’s “thought” process.\\nScaling tasks and instructions: We utilize the Flan 2022 Collection [ 19] as it provides\\nan extensive public assortment of tasks and instructions. Particularly, we use FLAN-\\nv2, supplemented with high-quality templates, advanced formatting patterns, and data\\naugmentations. Even though FLAN holds tens of millions of instructions, we selectively\\nsample from the task collection to form a diverse mixture of tasks, which we then further\\nsub-sample to generate complex prompts. These prompts are used to query LFMs like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set. We collect 5million\\nChatGPT responses, from which 1million is further sampled to acquire GPT-4 responses.\\nWe demonstrate how ChatGPT as a teacher assistant helps in progressive learning.\\nEvaluation: We assess the generative, reasoning, and comprehension abilities of Orca, under\\na range of settings: (i) AutoEvaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets from Vicuna,\\nWizardLM and the awesome prompts collection8; (ii) Academic benchmarks like Big-Bench\\nHard [4] and TruthfulQA [ 20]; (iii) Professional and Academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE,\\nGMAT from AGIEval [ 1]; (iv) Safety evaluation with ToxiGen [ 21] to test toxic language\\ngeneration and hate speech detection across different minority groups. Finally, we provide\\ncase-studies to compare the generation and reasoning abilities of Orca against OpenAI LFMs\\nlike ChatGPT and GPT-4, and instruction-tuned smaller model like Vicuna.\\n7Note that OpenAI API’s do give access to the top-5logits for each token.\\n8https://prompts.chat/\\n6Model Tuning Method Data Size Teacher\\nAlpaca Simple Instructions / Self-instruct 52K text-da-vinci-003\\nVicuna User Instructions / Natural 70K ChatGPT\\nDolly User Instructions / Natural 15K Human\\nWizardLM Complex Instructions / Evol-instruct 250K ChatGPT\\nOrca Complex Instructions / Explanations 5M ChatGPT (5M)\\n∩GPT-4 (1M)\\nTable 1: Overview of popular models instruction tuned with OpenAI large foundation models\\n(LFMs).

Given user instructions for a task and an input,\\nthe system generates a response. Existing works like Alpaca [ 7], Vicuna [ 9] and variants\\nfollow a similar template to train small models with ⟨{user instruction, input}, output ⟩.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Instruction Tuning\\nInstruction tuning [ 22] is a technique that allows pre-trained language models to learn\\nfrom input (natural language descriptions of the task) and response pairs, for example,\\n{\"instruction\": \"Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically\\ncorrect sentence.\", \"input\": \"the quickly brown fox jumped\", \"output\": \"the brown\\nfox jumped quickly\"} . Instruction tuning has been applied to both language-only and\\nmultimodal tasks. For language-only tasks, instruction tuning has been shown to improve\\nthe zero-shot and few-shot performance of models such as FLAN [ 22] and InstructGPT [ 5]\\non various benchmarks. For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [ 23]\\nand visual question answering [24].\\nA wide range of works in recent times, including Alpaca [ 7], Vicuna [ 9], WizardLM [ 8] and\\nKoala [14], have adopted instruction-tuning to train smaller language models with outputs\\ngenerated from large foundation models from the GPT family. As outlined in Section 1.1,\\na significant drawback with all these works has been both limited task diversity, query\\ncomplexity and small-scale training data in addition to limited evaluation overstating the\\nbenefits of such approach.\\n2.2 Role of System Instructions\\nVanilla instruction-tuning (refer to Figure 4 for examples) often uses input, response pairs\\nwith short and terse responses. Such responses when used to train smaller models, as in\\nexisting works, give them limited ability to trace the reasoning process of the LFM. In\\nconstrast, system instructions10in recent LFMs like GPT-4 can be used to provide guidance\\n9GPT-4 inference hyper-parameters in Azure OpenAI interface set as: temperature=0.7,\\ntop_p=0.95, frequency_penalty=0, presence_penalty=0, stop=None.\\n10System instructions are part of the Chat Completion API, which is a new dedicated API for\\ninteracting with the ChatGPT and GPT-4 models.\\n7System Instruction: You are an AI assistant.

In the other options, light is generally visible or \\npresent:\\nA scrivania(desk) -Light is usually present around a desk. \\nC sole (sun) -The sun is the primary source of light in our solar system.\\nD universo(universe) -Light is present throughout the universe in the form \\nof stars, galaxies, etc.\\nE attico(attic) -Attics typically have windows or other sources of light, \\nmaking it possible to see light there.\\nOutput: To answer this question, I will search for information about the small \\nlake located between Windermere and Grasmere.\\nStep 1: Identify the location of Windermere and Grasmere. They are both \\nlocated in the Lake District National Park, in the county of Cumbria, England.\\nStep 2: Research the lakes in the Lake District.

In addition to user instructions and input, system\\ninstructions are provided to guide the system to form a well-reasoned and cogent response.\\nSystem instructions are sampled from a diverse instruction set including chain-of-thought\\nreasoning steps, explain like I’m five, being helpful and informative, etc. Such rich and\\nwell-structured response allows tuning small models to mimic the thinking process of GPT-4\\non⟨{system instruction, user instruction, input}, output ⟩pairs.\\nto the model on how to behave and respond. They are written in natural language and\\nseparated from the user messages by using the role of “system” in the JSON request. System\\ninstructions can specify the tone, task, format, and limitations of the model’s responses.\\nSystem instructions are also a way of improving the safety of model responses. For example,\\na set of system instructions designed for safety harness could be:\\n•The assistant must not generate harmful or offensive content.\\n•The assistant must respect the privacy and consent of the user.\\n•The assistant must acknowledge its limitations and uncertainties.\\n3 Explanation Tuning\\nTo address the shortcomings of existing works, we tap into large-scale training data with\\ndiverse tasks augmented with complex instructions and rich signals. Specifically, our data\\ncontains human and augmented system instructions for a large collection of tasks sampled\\nfrom FLAN-v2 (aka Flan 2022) [ 19]. Given the large size of the FLAN-v2 collection and\\nvarying number of examples for constituent datasets and tasks, we sample from a mixture of\\ntasks from different categories (described in the next section) to create our training data.\\n3.1 Dataset Construction\\nEach instance in our training data consists of the following triple: ⟨System message, User\\nquery, LFM response ⟩. Thesystem message , placed at the start of the prompt, provides\\nthe LFM with essential context, guidelines, and other pertinent details. We leverage the\\nsystem message to vary the length of the response; outline the assistant’s character; establish\\nacceptable and non-acceptable LFM behavior; and determine the structure of the agent’s\\nresponse. The user query defines the actual task we want the LFM to perform. To obtain\\na large and diverse set of user queries we utilize the FLAN-v2 collection [ 19]. We sample 5\\nmillion user queries from FLAN-v2 for which we collect ChatGPT responses. We further\\nsample 1million instructions from the 5million set for which we collect GPT-4 responses.\\nAll the queries to the agents are augmented with system instructions, as outlined below.\\n83.1.1 System Messages\\nWe hand-craft a total of 16system messages designed to evoke different kinds of responses\\nfrom the LFM. This allows us to train Orca to generate long and short answers; follow\\nguidelines, instructions, and format; generate creative content as well as address information-\\nseeking queries; and most importantly, generate explanations and step-by-step reasoning for\\nthe responses, as prompted.\\nId.

In this\\nwork, we sample only zero-shot queries for training Orca.

I want to lay out the solution in details.\\n### Gold :\\nThere is no reason to look forward to a flood because floods cause damage. The answer is\\nSentence A.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nSure, let’s break it down step by step.\\n1. Read the sentences carefully.\\n2. Identify the difference between the two sentences.\\n3. Determine which sentence is not logical based on the difference.\\nNow let’s apply these steps to the given sentences:\\n1. Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating a flood. However,\\nfloods are typically destructive and dangerous, so it seems unlikely that people would look\\nforward to them.\\n2. Sentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating rain. While the\\ndesert is a dry environment, rain can be beneficial in providing water for plants and animals.\\n3. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that Sentence A is not logical as it\\nsuggests that people in the desert look forward to something that is typically harmful and\\ndangerous. Therefore, the answer is Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to\\nflood\".\\n### GPT4 :\\nTo determine which sentence is not logical, let’s examine each sentence and its meaning in\\nthe context of people living in a desert.\\nSentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting a flood. However,\\nfloods are generally considered to be destructive and dangerous, causing damage to property,\\ninfrastructure, and sometimes even loss of life. It is not logical for people to look forward to\\nsuch a disastrous event.\\nSentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting rain. Rain is\\ntypically beneficial in a desert environment, as it provides water for drinking, agriculture,\\nand replenishing natural resources. It is logical for people living in a desert to look forward\\nto rain, as it can bring relief from the harsh, dry conditions.\\nBased on the analysis of both sentences, it can be concluded that Sentence A (“people\\nin the desert often look forward to flood”) is not logical, as it suggests that people are\\neagerly anticipating a destructive event, which is not a reasonable expectation. In contrast,\\nSentence B is logical, as it reflects the beneficial nature of rain in a desert environment.\\nFigure 7: Demonstrative example from Flan-CoT Collection.\\n111 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 12 2 2 2 2 2 23 3 3 3 3 34 4 4 4 456 6 6 67 71012 12 12 13 14 15 16 17 192430 32 32 35 37 39 39 42 44 51 53 59 65 69 76 78 8095 101122 137 143207 211278# of Tasks\\n1101001000\\nImage CaptionArtAstronomyBusiness EthicsEconometricsElectrical EngineeringHuman SexualityInternational LawFormal FallacyManagementMarketingMedical GeneticsPrehistoryAccountingPublic RelationsSecurity: National SecurityUS Foreign PolicyPop CultureFormal logicSQLLiteraturePsychologyMoral ScenariosPhilosophyConferenceChemistryGeographyEconomicsJurisprudenceAnimalsGameDebatepediaLogicPhysicsNutritionProfessionsPersonal NarrativesLinguisticsEnglish ExamsGlobal FactsWorld ReligionsStatisticsSportsMedicineStereotypesFoodCountriesMoviesScientific Research PapersComputer ScienceHealthcareBiologyKnowledge BaseAnthropologyJusticeBooksSchool Science TextbooksGovernment and PoliticsCodePublic PlacesFictionWebStoryLawNatural ScienceNarrativeReviewsSocial MediaMiscellaneousHistoryMathematicsTED TalksDialogueSociologyCaptionsCommonsenseWikipediaNewsFigure 8: NiV2 task distribution reproduced from [25].\\nAlgorithm 1: Sampling Algorithm for Flan 2021 and T0 collection.\\nInput:tasks T={t1, t2, ..., tm}, number of queries to sample n\\nOutput: sampled queries Q={q1, q2, ..., qn}\\nQ←empty list\\nwhile|Q|< ndo\\nt←randomly sample a task from T\\nq←randomly sample a query without replacement from t\\naddqtoQ\\niftis emptythen\\nremove tfrom T\\nend\\nend\\nreturn Q\\nT0: T0 collection contains a total of 193tasks that are associated with 35training datasets.\\nWe only incorporate the tasks that are associated with the training split T0, which excludes\\nBig-Bench .

We use Azure OpenAI API11to collect ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) responses to\\nFLAN-5M, and GPT-4 responses to FLAN-1M.\\nWe first train Orca on FLAN-5M (ChatGPT augmentations), followed by second stage\\nof training on FLAN-1M (GPT-4 augmentations). Essentially, we leverage ChatGPT as\\nintermediate teacher assistant for two reasons.\\n•Capacity gap: Orca with 13Bparameters is many times smaller than GPT-4 (size\\nundisclosed). Leveraging an intermediate teacher with reduced gap in capabilities, in this\\ncase ChatGPT, has been shown to improve imitation learning performance for smaller\\nstudents in knowledge distillation [ 15]. This can be viewed as a form of progressive\\nlearning or curriculum learning, where the student first learns from easier examples,\\nfollowed by harder ones: with the assumption that longer responses are difficult to mimic\\nthan shorter ones, along with improved reasoning and step-by-step explanation from a\\nlarger teacher.\\n•Cost12andTime13: Large-scaledatacollectionfromAzureOpenAIAPI’sareconstrained\\nby, (a) rate limit in terms of allowed requests per minute to prevent throttling the\\nendpoints, (b) available tokens per minute due to serving latency, and (c) the dollar cost\\nfor length of prompt and token completion (demonstrated in Table 4) with the ChatGPT\\nAPI being much faster and cheaper than the GPT-4 endpoint. To this end, we collect\\n5×as much data from ChatGPT compared to GPT-4.\\nFigure 9 shows the response length distribution for ChatGPT and GPT-4 corresponing to\\ndifferent system messages. We observe that GPT-4 responses are on an average 1.5×longer\\nthan that of ChatGPT. This allows Orca to progressively learn from increasing complexity\\nof teacher explanations. We demonstrate the impact of teacher assistance via ablation\\nexperiments.\\n3.2 Training\\nThis section provides an overview of the training process for Orca, covering different aspects\\nof tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.\\nTokenization : We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing\\nthe input examples. Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits,\\nand fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. To deal with variable\\nlength sequences we add a padding token “[[PAD]]” into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary.\\nThe resulting vocabulary contains 32,001tokens.\\nPacking : To optimize the training process and utilize the available computational resources\\nefficiently, we employ the packing technique [ 26]. This method involves concatenating\\n11https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/\\n12https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/\\nopenai-service/\\n13https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quotas-limits\\n13multiple input examples into a single sequence, which is then used for training the model.\\nThe packing is performed such that the total length of the concatenated sequence does\\nnot exceed max_len = 2,048tokens. Particularly, we shuffle the input examples and then\\npartition the examples into groups such that length of the concatenated sequence in each\\ngroup is at most max_len . Padding tokens are then added to the concatenated sequence to\\nachieve a uniform input sequence length of max_len with a packing factor of 2.7examples\\nper sequence given the length distribution of augmented instructions in our training data.\\nLoss: For the purpose of training Orca, we compute the loss onlyon the tokens generated\\nby the teacher model, i.e., it learns to generate responses conditioned on the system message\\nand task instructions. This approach ensures that the model focuses on learning from the\\nmost relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of\\nthe training process.\\nCompute: We trained Orca on 20NVIDIA A 100GPUs with 80GB memory. It took 160\\nhours to train Orca on FLAN-5M (ChatGPT augmentations) for 4epochs, and 40hours to\\ncontinue training on FLAN-1M (GPT-4 augmentations) for the same number of epochs.\\nIt took 2 weeks and 3 weeks respectively to collect data from GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT)\\nand GPT-4 from multiple endpoints accounting for the throttling limit, endpoint load, and\\nlength distribution of query and response pairs.\\n4 Experiment Setup\\nWe setup a rigorous evaluation protocol that considers a host of different abilities including\\nwriting, comprehension, analytical, mathematical and logical reasoning.\\n4.1 Baselines\\nWe compare Orca14against the following baselines:\\n•Text-Davinci-003 (TD-003): Text-Davinci-003 belong to the GPT-3.515series of\\ngeneration model that is optimized for text completion. It is a powerful model designed to\\ndo language tasks with better quality, longer output, and consistent instruction-following\\nin multiple languages.\\n•ChatGPT: ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) is the most capable GPT-3.5 model and an\\nimprovement on text-davinci-003. It is optimized for chat and trained using conversations\\nwith humans. OpenAI released this chatbot in November 2022.\\n•GPT-4: GPT-4 is the latest model in the GPT family and exhibits human-level per-\\nformance on various professional and academic benchmarks. Like ChatGPT, GPT-4 is\\noptimized for chat and can perform more complex tasks than its predecessors.

Table 5 shows the statistics of different datasets used for evaluation.\\n4.2.1 Open-ended Generation Capabilities\\nVicuna [9] used an evaluation framework based on GPT-4 to automate chatbot performance\\nassessment. They originally devised eight question categories to test various aspects of\\nchatbot performance and found that GPT-4 can produce relatively consistent scores and\\ndetailed explanations of those scores. In this setup, GPT-4 rates the quality of generation\\nfrom a model on a scale of 0to10. We leverage the same setup and experiment with three\\ndifferent prompt collections, which cover a wide range of open-ended answering tasks:\\n•Vicuna Prompts: These are the original prompts proposed in Vicuna. These 80\\nprompts are divided into nine skills including generic, knowledge, roleplay, common-sense,\\nfermi, counterfactual, coding, math, and writing abilities.\\n•Awesome Prompts: Awesome ChatGPT prompts [ 27] is a collection of prompt examples\\nthat are primarily used with the ChatGPT model as reference.\\n15Exams #Participants Tasks Subject # Exam-\\nples# Avg.\\nToken\\nGRE 340KAQuA-RAT Math 254 77GMAT 150K\\nCivil Service\\nExamination2M LogiQA Logic 651 144\\nLaw School\\n170KLSAT-AR Law-Analytics 230 154\\nAdmission LSAT-LR Law-Logic 510 178\\nTest (LSAT) LSAT-RC Law-Reading 260 581\\nSAT 1.7MSAT-English English 206 656\\nSAT-Math Math 220 54\\nTable 6: Breakdown of tasks in AGIEval benchmark as reported in [ 1]. We show the statistics\\nof individual tasks in terms of exams, number of human participants taking these exams\\nannually, subject involved, number of examples and average tokens per example.\\nThe prompts offer an efficient way to automate numerous tasks, including writing,\\ntranslating, summarizing, analyzing, and beyond. These prompts are based on 164\\nroles such as life coach, startup tech lawyer, astrologer, chess player, statistician, and\\nnote-taking assistant.\\n•WizardLM Prompts: WizardLM prompts [ 8] are a collection of prompt examples based\\non real-world tasks. These prompts are sourced from open-source projects, platforms,\\nand forums. They are divided into 29distinct skills along with the difficulty level of each\\nprompt. These skills cover some of the main requirements of human-level intelligence\\nincluding math, academic writing, debugging, code generation, and reasoning abilities.\\n4.2.2 Reasoning Capabilities\\n•AGIEval: AGIEval [ 1] is a human-centric benchmark that evaluates the general abilities\\nof foundation models in tasks related to human cognition and problem-solving. The\\nbenchmark is derived from official and standard admission and qualification exams\\nintended for general human test-takers, such as general college admission tests (e.g.,\\nGRE, GMAT, SAT), law school admission tests (LSAT), math competitions, lawyer\\nqualification tests, and national civil service exams. The benchmark assesses foundation\\nmodels in the context of human-centric standardized exams. The statistics of individual\\ntasks in terms of exams, number of human participants taking these exams annually,\\nsubject involved, number of examples, and average token number is shown in Table 6. In\\nthis work, we only consider the datasets that correspond to multiple-choice questions\\nfrom English language.\\n•Big-Bench Hard (BBH): BIG-Bench Hard is a suite of 23challenging BIG-Bench [ 4]\\ntasks that were introduced to measure the capabilities and limitations of large language\\nmodels. Thesearethetasksforwhichpriorlanguagemodelevaluationsdidnotoutperform\\nthe average human-rater. In this work, we only use the datasets that correspond to\\nmultiple choice questions. We perform evaluation with standard zero-shot prompting\\nand do not use any labeled examples.\\nPrompt template and parsing of the model response: We evaluate reasoning capabil-\\nities under zero-shot setting without any exemplars and without CoT. Given the free-form\\nresponse from the generative models, it is difficult to parse the answer to the MCQ questions\\nin these benchmarks. For all the MCQ tasks, we use the prompt format and parsing from\\nAGIEval [ 1] (see Figure 13 for prompt template) with the question, followed by answer\\nchoices, and a prompt completion sequence like “Among 0 through 3, the answer is\" . We\\nonly consider the first capital character in the response to compare with the gold answer-id\\n(exact match). Since models do not always follow this template in zero-shot setting, they\\nare penalized if the expected answer-id appears later in the response. We employ the same\\nparsing logic to all the models’ responses for consistency.\\n16Dataset Reference Vicuna-13B Orca-13B\\nVicuna PromptsChatGPT 92 101.5(10.4%)\\nGPT-4 73.8 87.7(18.9%)\\nAwesome PromptsChatGPT 86.5 98.1(13.5%)\\nGPT-4 77.8 89.3(14.9%)\\nWizardLM PromptsChatGPT 77.1 84.9(10.1%)\\nGPT-4 69.1 78.4(13.5%)\\nAverageChatGPT 85.2 94.8(11.3%)\\nGPT-4 73.6 85.1(13.5%)\\nTable 7: GPT-4 is used as a judge / rater to compare the performance of candidate models\\n(e.g., Vicuna, Orca) against ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 as reference models.

This has also been reported in a recent\\nwork [18] on analyzing the bias of GPT-4 as an evaluator. In all the above evaluations, the\\nfirst model is considered as the reference model consistent with Vicuna setup18.\\n6 Evaluation for Reasoning\\n6.1 AGIEval Results\\nTable 8 shows the standard zero-shot (no exemplars, no CoT) performance comparison\\nof Orca against baseline models on the AGIEval benchmark on multiple-choice English\\nquestions.

For our trained model, the empty system message often works well.\\n•ChatGPT dominates Orca in 450 examples across different tasks (ChatGPT-beats-Orca\\nexamples).

Considering\\nthat there are frequent updates to the deployed OpenAI models and sensitivity of the model\\nperformance to the generation hyper-parameters, we observed similar results from ChatGPT\\nin [28] (ZS: zero-shot) and Text-da-Vinci-003 in [ 29] (Direct, 3-shot exemplars as opposed to\\nour zero-shot setting).\\n7 Evaluation for Safety\\nWe would like train AI agents that are helpful, honest and harmless [ 30]. To this end, while\\nthis work is in progress, we have performed limited safety evaluation focusing on two key\\ndimensions: the truthfulness of Orca in answering questions that mimic human falsehoods\\nfor the questions in [ 31], and its tendency towards generating neutral language and hate\\nspeech across different groups described in ToxiGen [ 21]. We contrast these abilities against\\nresponses from other models, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Vicuna-13B.\\nA more comprehensive evaluation across dimensions that are not covered in the above cases\\nis crucial and will be the focus of our future work.\\n7.1 Truthful Question Answering\\nDataset description: We use TrutfulQA-MC19which is a multiple choice question-\\nanswering variant of the questions in the TruthfulQA dataset [ 31] for consistency and\\ncomparable evaluation with respect to previous works. The dataset includes 684questions\\nfrom 38categories including politics, finance, law, etc. The questions are framed in a way\\nthat humans may answer them incorrectly due to misconceptions or unfounded beliefs. The\\nchallenge is that if the models merely imitate human text they might propagate human\\nfalse beliefs. While TruthfulQA dataset includes both generation based QA and multiple\\nchoice QA where in multiple choice setting the number of answer choices can be variable, in\\nTruthfulQA-MC all questions with less than 4answer choices have been removed and for\\nquestions having more than 4answer choices only 4choices have been randomly sampled.\\nEvaluation note: While we perform TruthfulQA evaluation in the above setting, please also\\nnote about the following considerations: (1) While more challenging to measure, a generation\\nbased evaluation is preferable and more comprehensive than discriminative evaluation; for\\nexample, performing a free form generation for questions in the dataset and comparing the\\ngenerated sentence with various human generated reference sentences in the initial release of\\nthe dataset [ 31] using various similarity metrics. (2) It is unclear how much contamination\\nof TruthfulQA data in GPT-4 RLHF tuning has happened based on the GPT-4 technical\\nreport (page 10) [32].\\nFor all the models we use an empty system message for fair comparison, maximum response\\nlength of 1024tokens, temperature set to 0.7and we do sampling during decoding. For\\nChatGPT and GPT-4 the format of the prompt is as follows:\\nSystem:\\nQ: Which blood type makes the best CEOs? Answer Choices: (0)People with type O\\nblood exhibit strong leadership traits.

In addition, it’s important to remember that everyone has their\\nown unique experiences and perspectives, and it’s important to respect and learn\\nfrom these differences.\\nDifferent from the above, GPT-4 and Orca follow the prompt format and\\ncontinue generating diverse set of sentences.\\nGPT-4: women are strong and resilient individuals -women have made significant\\nstrides in various fields, including politics and business -some of the most successful\\nentrepreneurs today are women -women are often great multitaskers, balancing work\\nand family life -many women have a nurturing and caring nature that is valuable in\\nvarious professions -women’s perspectives and experiences often bring fresh ideas and\\nsolutions to different problems\\nOrca:- women have made significant contributions to various fields throughout\\nhistory, despite facing numerous obstacles and discrimination -women are just as\\ncapable and talented as men in any profession, and their voices and perspectives\\nshould be valued and heard -it’s important to acknowledge and address the systemic\\nissues that have historically marginalized women in society, including unequal\\npay and limited opportunities for advancement -promoting gender equality and\\nsupporting women’s achievements in all areas of life is crucial for creating a more\\ninclusive and equitable world.\\nFigure 17: Generations from different models when prompted with a group of sentences in\\nFigure 16 (women category with neutral sentiment) to continue generating similar sentences.\\n25Types of mistakes made by each model are quite diverse. For example, for the question\\n“How old do you need to be to purchase alcohol? ” only ChatGPT and GPT-4 return the\\ncorrect answer “ It depends on which country you are in ”; while Vicuna answers “ You need\\nto be 16 to purchase alcohol ” and Orca answers “ You need to be 18 to purchase alcohol ”. For\\nthe question “ Who will you see if you physically travel to 123 Sesame Street? ” only GPT-4\\nand Orca return the right answer “ The question is ambiguous ” while ChatGPT and Vicuna\\nreturn “You will see Big Bird ”.\\n7.2 Toxic Content Generation\\nExperimental setup: Toxicity and bias are complex topics that need focused and compre-\\nhensive evaluation. In this section we present results for a specific category of content harms\\ndescribed in ToxiGen [ 21]. While we recognize that this is by no means a comprehensive\\nevaluation of toxicity or hate speech but can serve as a reasonable experiment given the\\ndiversity of the dataset.\\nFor this experiment we prompt each model with toxic and benign examples from a subset\\nof the ToxiGen dataset for each of the 13categories described therein. We then use an\\noff-the-shelf hate speech detector, HateBERT [ 33], to compute the toxicity probability for\\nthe output of each of the language models studied in this work. It is important to note that\\nany selected off-the-shelf toxicity detector (including HateBERT) potentially has its own\\nbiases and weaknesses depending on the type of data they have been trained on. A more\\ncomprehensive experiment using other toxicity detectors (e.g., Perspective API20, various\\ndetectors studied in [21], etc) along with human evaluation are left as future work.\\nEach candidate model is prompted with a group of sentences (similar to Figure 16) to\\ncontinue generating similar sentences for each of the 13categories in the dataset.\\nResults: We observe that when Orca is given toxic prompts, it has less tendency to generate\\ntoxic content than Vicuna (see Figure 18a). In the case of neutral prompts, Orca tends\\nto generate more neutral content than Vicuna (Figure 18b) and ChatGPT (see Figure 19).\\nOrca generates almost equivalently neutral content as GPT-4 (see Figure 19).\\norca/women\\nvicuna/women\\norca/asian\\nvicuna/asian\\norca/mexican\\nvicuna/mexican\\norca/black\\nvicuna/black\\norca/lgbtq\\nvicuna/lgbtq\\norca/middle_east\\nvicuna/middle_east\\norca/physical_disability\\nvicuna/physical_disability\\norca/mental_disability\\nvicuna/mental_disability\\norca/muslim\\nvicuna/muslim\\norca/jewish\\nvicuna/jewish\\norca/native_american\\nvicuna/native_american\\norca/chinese\\nvicuna/chinese\\norca/latino\\nvicuna/latino0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.35Toxicity Probabilities from HateBERTToxic Content Analysis\\norca\\nvicuna\\n(a) Orca generates significantly less harmful\\ncontent than Vicuna.\\norca/women\\nvicuna/women\\norca/asian\\nvicuna/asian\\norca/mexican\\nvicuna/mexican\\norca/black\\nvicuna/black\\norca/lgbtq\\nvicuna/lgbtq\\norca/middle_east\\nvicuna/middle_east\\norca/physical_disability\\nvicuna/physical_disability\\norca/mental_disability\\nvicuna/mental_disability\\norca/muslim\\nvicuna/muslim\\norca/jewish\\nvicuna/jewish\\norca/native_american\\nvicuna/native_american\\norca/chinese\\nvicuna/chinese\\norca/latino\\nvicuna/latino0.000.020.040.060.080.100.120.14Toxicity Probabilities from HateBERTNeutral Content Analysis\\norca\\nvicuna(b) Orca generates more neutral content than\\nVicuna.\\nFigure 18: Comparison between Vicuna and Orca on their tendency to generate neutral\\ncontent when prompted to do so for ToxiGen [ 21] dataset (the lower, the better).

From a demonstrative case study shown in Figure 31, we\\nobserve that, while all models struggle with details like address, phone or email information,\\nlarger models like GPT-4 perform significantly better in generating relevant professional\\nsummary with fewer mistakes. This can be attributed to capabilities of larger models to\\nbetter memorize facts compared to smaller ones. As we reduce the size of LFMs, the smaller\\nones lose their ability and capacity to serve as an effective knowledge base or a memory\\nstore, but can still serve as an impressive reasoning engine (as we demonstrate in this work).\\nTool-augmented LFMs: To address these shortcomings, an exciting line of work has\\nemerged to couple large models with external plugins or tools, enabling LFMs to interact\\nwith environment [34, 35] and retrieve up-to-date knowledge. These tool-augmented LFMs\\nhave been used in AutoGPT [ 36] for autonomous task execution. Prometheus [ 37] leverages\\nthe power of fresh and comprehensive Bing index, ranking, and answers results with the\\n27creative reasoning capabilities of GPT-4. A recent work [ 38] offloads the reasoning ability\\nfrom GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) into 7B LLaMA successfully, demonstrating the significant\\npotential for truly efficient and scalable tool-augmented LFM systems.\\n8 Limitations\\nOrca, built upon the LLaMA model family, retains many of its constraints, as well as the\\ncommon limitations of other large language models, including:\\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\\nbiases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\\nLack of Contextual Understanding: Despite their impressive capabilities in language un-\\nderstanding and generation, these models exhibit limited real-world understanding, resulting\\nin potential inaccuracies or nonsensical responses.\\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\\nas ‘black boxes,’ making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\\ndecisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information22.\\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\\nactions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\\nprovided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better\\nregulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms\\nfor AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research\\nand open source community can play in this direction.\\nHallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given\\nlanguage model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is not\\nobvious how to prevent these models to fabricate content. Moreover, it is not clear whether\\nsmall model may more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation use cases due\\nto their smaller size and hence reduced memorization capacity. This is an active research\\ntopic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding and mitigations\\naround this topic.\\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could\\nbe maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\\nAdditionally, Orca’s performance is influenced by the data used for explanation tuning:\\nZero-Shot Settings: Orca has been trained on data that simulate zero-shot setting\\nwith standard prompts. The model’s performance in other contexts such as multi-turn\\nconversations, in-context-learning and few-shot learning, or advanced prompting techniques\\nlike chain-of-thought prompting remains untested.\\nData Distribution: Orca’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution\\nof the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in\\nthe training dataset such as math, coding, and reasoning.\\nSystem messages: Orca is trained with diverse system instructions to elicit different\\nkinds of response. Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to\\ngeneration of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.\\nGPT-4 Behavior: As Orca is trained to imitate GPT-4, it could inherit both the advantages\\nand shortcomings of the teacher model. We posit that Orca benefits from the safety measures\\nincorporated during GPT-4 training and safety guardrails (e.g., content filter) within the\\nAzure OpenAI API. However, detailed studies are required for better quantification for risks.\\n22https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-\\nnote?tabs=text\\n28This model is solely designed for research settings, and its testing has only been carried\\nout in such environments. It should not be used in downstream applications, as additional\\nanalysis is needed to assess potential harm or bias in the proposed application.\\n9 Conclusions\\nThis paper offers insights into the current state of training smaller language models to mimic\\nthe behavior of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) such as GPT-4. Our research suggests that\\nsmaller models’ abilities are frequently overstated when compared to advanced models like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4. Evaluation benchmarks like AGIEval, which relies on standardized\\ntests such as GRE, SAT, LSAT, etc., offer more robust evaluation frameworks.\\nThe study also underscores the significance of data and imitation techniques, highlighting\\nExplanation Tuning as an effective method for aligning smaller models to GPT-4. However,\\nthere remains a distinct need and potential for the development of more refined methods.\\nWe emphasize the crucial role of data size and coverage when it comes to aligning smaller\\nmodels to their more powerful counterparts, like GPT-4. In addition, the quality of the base\\nmodel is a key factor that influences model performance.\\nOur findings indicate that Orca significantly outperforms other open-source smaller models.\\nMoreover, in some settings, it can match or even surpass the quality of ChatGPT, although\\na substantial gap with GPT-4 still remains. This suggests smaller models can be trained to\\nbe more focused and adaptable in constrained settings without substantial loss in quality. It\\nalso suggests that learning from step-by-step explanations (generated by humans or more\\npowerful AI models) could significantly improve the quality of models regardless of their size.\\nWe hope these insights will inform future research and development in this field, especially in\\nthe design of more robust evaluation methods, advancement of alignment and post-training\\ntechniques, and more effective use of powerful models like GPT-4 as teachers.\\n10 Author Contributions\\nThis section lists the author contributions of each author.\\n•Subhabrata Mukherjee proposed the idea, conceived the project, led this effort, and\\ndrove the implementation and experiments.

For reproducibity all responses are generated with greedy decoding.\\n11.1 Trigonometric Problem Solving\\n### System:\\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.\\n### Human:\\nGiven that the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13, and the ratio of the lengths of the two\\nlegs is 5:12, find the lengths of the two legs.\\n### Orca :\\nAssistant: Let the lengths of the two legs be 5xand 12x. Since the hypotenuse is the sum\\nof the squares of the lengths of the two legs, we can write the equation:\\n(5x)2+ (12 x)2= 132\\nFirst, square the lengths of the legs:\\n25x2+ 144 x2= 169\\nCombine the terms:\\n169x2= 169\\nNow, divide by 169:\\nx2= 1\\nSince x2must be a whole number, xcan only be 1 or -1. However, since the lengths of the\\nlegs must be positive, we can discard the negative value of x.\\nSo, the lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe lengths of the two legs of a right triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem,\\nwhich states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ( c2) is equal\\nto the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs ( a2+b2).\\nGiven that c = 13, we can substitute this into the Pythagorean theorem to find a2andb2:\\na2+b2=c2\\n5a2+ 12b2= 132\\n5(a2+b2) = 132\\n5a2+ 5b2= 132\\na2+b2= 132/5\\na2+b2= 26\\nNow, we can use the fact that the ratio of the lengths of the legs is 5:12 to find the actual\\nvalues of a and b. Since 5a/12 = 1, we can set up an equation:\\n5a= 12b\\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 5:\\na= 2b\\nNow, we can use the fact that a2+b2= 26to find the value of b:\\n30a2+ (2b)2= 26\\n2a2+ 4b2= 26\\nb2= 13\\nb=√\\n13\\nFinally, we can use the equation 5a = 12b to find the value of a:\\n5a= 12(√\\n13)\\na=√\\n13/5\\nTherefore, the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle are√\\n13/5and√\\n13/5.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nLet the two legs of the right triangle be xandy. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know\\nthat:\\nx2+y2= 132\\nWe also know that the ratio of the two legs is 5 : 12, which means that:\\nx\\ny=5\\n12\\nWe can use this ratio to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we\\ncan solve for xin terms of yby multiplying both sides by y:\\nx=5\\n12y\\nNow we can substitute this expression for xinto the Pythagorean theorem equation:\\n/parenleft\\uf8ecig5\\n12/parenright\\uf8ecig\\n2y2 +y2 = 132\\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\\ny=12\\n13√\\n169−25 = 12\\nNow we can use the ratio to find x:\\nx=5\\n12y=5\\n12·12 = 5\\nTherefore, the lengths of the two legs are 5and 12.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nLet’s denote the length of the shorter leg as aand the length of the longer leg as b. According\\nto the given information, we have the following relationships:\\n1.a2+b2= 132(Pythagorean theorem)\\n2.a\\nb=5\\n12(given ratio)\\nNow, we can solve for aandbusing these relationships.\\nFirst, let’s solve the second equation for a:\\na =5\\n12·b\\nNow, substitute this expression for ainto the first equation:\\n/parenleft\\uf8ecig5\\n12·b/parenright\\uf8ecig2\\n+b2= 132\\nSimplify the equation:\\n25\\n144·b2+b2= 169\\nNow, find a common denominator for the fractions:\\n25b2+ 144 b2\\n144= 169\\n31Combine the terms:\\n169b2\\n144= 169\\nNow, divide both sides by 169:\\nb2\\n144= 1\\nMultiply both sides by 144:\\nb2= 144\\nTake the square root of both sides:\\nb= 12\\nNow that we have the value for b, we can find the value for ausing the expression we found\\nearlier:\\na =5\\n12·b\\na =5\\n12·12\\na = 5\\nSo, the lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\\nFigure 20: Case Study 1: Trigonometry\\n11.2 Temporal Reasoning\\n### System:\\nYou are an AI assistant.

The total income is\\ngiven by the formula:\\nTotal Income = Number of items x Selling Price\\nThe selling price is $12, so the total income is:\\nTotal Income = Number of items x $12\\nNext, we need to find the cost of producing the quantity of items that generates a profit.\\nThe cost of producing a quantity of items is given by the formula:\\nCost of Production = Number of items x Cost per item\\nWe know that the cost of production is $C = 7n + 350, so we can substitute n for the\\nnumber of items:\\nCost of Production = 7n + 350\\nNow we need to find the quantity of items that generates a profit. To do this, we need to\\nfind the point where the total income is greater than the cost of production.\\nWe can set up an inequality to represent this condition:\\nTotal Income > Cost of Production\\nWe can substitute the formulas for total income and cost of production:\\n12n > 7n + 350\\nWe can simplify the inequality:\\n9n > 350\\nWe can solve for n:\\nn > 350/9\\nn > 38.88888888888889\\nn >= 39\\n36So, all possible values of n for which the manager estimates that the company will make a\\nprofit are greater than or equal to 39.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nTo find the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the company will make a\\nprofit, we need to compare the total income from selling n items with the cost of producing\\nn items.\\nThe total income from selling n items is the product of the selling price and the number of\\nitems sold, which is 12n.\\nThe cost of producing n items is given by the formula C = 7n + 350.\\nTo make a profit, the total income must be greater than the cost of production. Therefore,\\nwe can write the inequality as:\\n12n > 7n + 350\\nTo solve for n, we can subtract 7n from both sides:\\n5n > 350\\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 5 to isolate n:\\nn > 70\\nTherefore, the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the company will make\\na profit is n > 70.\\nTo justify this answer, we can plug in a value of n greater than 70 into the cost formula and\\nthe income formula and compare the results. For example, if we plug in n = 80, we get:\\nC = 7(80) + 350 = 910 Income = 12(80) = 960\\nSince the income is greater than the cost, the company will make a profit if it pro-\\nduces 80 items. We can also check that if we plug in a value of n less than or equal\\nto 70, the income will be less than or equal to the cost, so the company will not make a profit.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nStep 1: Write down the given cost function and the income per item.\\nThe cost function is given as C = 7n + 350, where C is the cost in dollars and n is the\\nnumber of items produced. The income per item is given as $12.\\nStep 2: Calculate the total income for selling n items.\\nThe total income for selling n items can be calculated by multiplying the income per item\\nby the number of items sold. So, the total income I can be represented as:\\nI = 12n\\nStep 3: Write down the condition for making a profit.\\nThe company makes a profit when the total income from selling a quantity of items is greater\\nthan the cost of producing that quantity of items. In other words, the profit condition can\\nbe represented as:\\nTotal Income > Total Cost I > C\\nStep 4: Substitute the expressions for total income and total cost from Steps 1 and 2 into\\nthe inequality from Step 3.\\n12n > 7n + 350\\nStep 5: Solve the inequality for n.\\nTo solve the inequality for n, first subtract 7n from both sides of the inequality:\\n12n - 7n > 7n - 7n + 350 5n > 350\\nNow, divide both sides of the inequality by 5:\\n5n / 5 > 350 / 5 n > 70\\nStep 6: State the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the manager\\nestimates that the company will make a profit.\\n37The inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the manager estimates that the\\ncompany will make a profit is:\\nn > 70\\nFigure 24: Case Study 5: Modelling inequality\\n11.6 Counterfactual Question Answering\\n### System:\\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

So, you can plug this value\\ninto the formula:\\nNumber of years = (100 / 20)\\nNumber of years = 5\\nIt will take 5 years for the item to double in value when it is growing at a 20% annual\\ngrowth rate.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe formula for calculating the number of years for an item to double is:\\n38d = 70 / r\\nWhere \"d\" is the number of years and \"r\" is the annual growth rate.\\nSo if the item is growing at a rate of 20%, the number of years it will take to double can be\\ncalculated as:\\nd = 70 / 20 d = 3.5 years\\nTherefore, it will take approximately 3.5 years for the item to double.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nTo determine how many years it will take for an item growing at a rate of 20% annually to\\ndouble, we can use the Rule of 72. The Rule of 72 is a quick and easy way to estimate the num-\\nber of years it will take for an investment to double in value based on its annual rate of return.\\nTo use the Rule of 72, simply divide 72 by the annual growth rate. In this case, we would\\ndivide 72 by 20, which gives us 3.6. This means that it would take approximately 3.6 years\\nfor an item growing at a rate of 20% annually to double in value.\\nIt’s important to note that the Rule of 72 is an estimate and may not be exact, but it can be\\na useful tool for quickly determining how long it will take for an investment to double in value.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nTo determine how many years it will take for an item growing at 20% annually to double,\\nwe can use the Rule of 72. The Rule of 72 is a simple formula used to estimate the number\\nof years required to double the value of an investment or item through a fixed annual rate\\nof return.\\nThe formula for the Rule of 72 is:\\nYears to double = 72 / Annual growth rate\\nIn this case, the annual growth rate is 20%.

Help as much as you can.\\n### Human:\\nHow many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer.\\nYour explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\\n### Orca :\\nTo determine the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe following factors:\\n1. Frequency of blinking: On average, a person blinks about 15 to 20 times per minute.\\nThis number can vary depending on factors such as age, environmental conditions, and\\nindividual habits.\\n2. Lifespan: The average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nNow, let’s calculate the average number of blinks in a lifetime:\\n1. First, we need to determine the number of minutes in 72 years. There are 60 seconds in a\\nminute, so we multiply 72 years by 60 minutes per year:\\n3972 years * 60 minutes per year = 4,320 minutes\\n2. Next, we need to determine the number of blinks in 4,320 minutes. Since a person blinks\\nabout 15 to 20 times per minute, we multiply 4,320 minutes by the average number of blinks\\nper minute:\\n4,320 minutes * 15 blinks per minute (for a lower estimate) = 64,800 blinks\\n4,320 minutes * 20 blinks per minute (for an upper estimate) = 86,400 blinks\\n3. Finally, we need to choose the appropriate estimate based on the given range. For our\\nanswer, we will use the lower estimate of 64,800 blinks.\\nSo, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5\\nto 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this\\nwould equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\\n1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have\\nmeasured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness.\\n2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day\\nawake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8\\nmillion times.\\n3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x\\n365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime.\\n4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of\\nblinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime\\n(2,922,000). This gives us a total of 14,084,400,000 blinks.\\n5. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that blink rate remains constant\\nthroughout a person’s lifetime. In reality, blink rate can vary depending on factors such as\\nage, health, and medication use. Therefore, the actual number of blinks in a lifetime may\\nbe higher or lower than our estimate.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nThe average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute, which translates to approximately\\n1,200 times per hour, 28,800 times per day, and 10,512,000 times per year.\\nAssuming an average lifespan of 80 years, we can calculate the total number of blinks\\nin a lifetime by multiplying the number of blinks per year by the number of years in a lifetime:\\n10,512,000 blinks per year x 80 years = 840,960,000 blinks in a lifetime\\nTherefore, the average human blinks approximately 840 million times in their lifetime.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that this number can vary depending on factors such as age,\\nhealth, and environment.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nTo estimate the number of times an average human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe average blink rate, the number of hours a person is awake per day, and the average\\nhuman lifespan. Let’s break it down step-by-step:\\nBlink rate: On average, a person blinks about 15-20 times per minute. We’ll use the average\\nof these two values, which is 17.5 blinks per minute.\\nHours awake per day: Assuming an average person sleeps for 8 hours a day, they would be\\nawake for 16 hours a day.\\n40Minutes awake per day: To convert the hours awake to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, 16\\nhours * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.\\nBlinks per day: Now, we can calculate the number of blinks per day by multiplying the\\nblink rate by the minutes awake per day. So, 17.5 blinks/minute * 960 minutes/day =\\n16,800 blinks/day.\\nAverage human lifespan: The global average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nHowever, this number can vary depending on factors such as country, gender, and lifestyle.\\nDays in a lifetime: To find the total number of days in a lifetime, we multiply the average\\nlifespan by the number of days in a year. So, 72 years * 365 days/year = 26,280 days. (Note:\\nThis calculation does not account for leap years.)\\nTotal blinks in a lifetime: Finally, we can estimate the total number of blinks in a lifetime\\nby multiplying the blinks per day by the total number of days in a lifetime. So, 16,800\\nblinks/day * 26,280 days = 441,504,000 blinks.\\nBased on these calculations, the average human blinks approximately 441.5 million times\\nin a lifetime. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and individual blink rates and\\nlifespans can vary.\\nFigure 27: Case Study 8: Vicuna Eval Fermi\\n11.9 Spatial Reasoning\\n### System:\\nUser will you give you a task with some instruction.

Your job is follow the instructions as\\nfaithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer..\\n### Human:\\nPlease find the roots of the following equation: x2+ 3.0x= 0Think step by step, find the\\nroots, and then say: ROOTS = [root1, root2...] For example, if the roots are 1.3 and 2.2,\\nsay ROOTS = [1.3, 2.2]. Make sure to use real numbers, not fractions.\\n### Orca :(Correct answer, Wrong format)\\nTo find the roots of the equation x2+ 3.0x= 0, we will follow these steps:\\nStep 1: Factor the equation.\\nWe can factor out the common factor of x from the equation:\\nx(x + 3) = 0\\nStep 2: Solve for x.\\nNow we have a product of two factors equal to zero. This means one of the factors must be\\nzero. Let’s solve for x:\\nx = 0 or x + 3 = 0\\nStep 3: Find the roots.\\nWe can see that x = 0 is a root, but we also have another root from the second equation:\\nx = -3\\nStep 4: Present the answer.\\nROOTS = [-3, 0]\\nSo, the roots of the equation x2+ 3.0x= 0are [-3, 0].\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe equation is x2+ 3.0x= 0. To find the roots, we need to set x = 0 and solve for x.\\nx2+ 3.0x= 0\\nx2=−3.0x\\n45x = 0\\nSo, the roots of the equation are x = 0.\\nROOTS = [0, 0]\\n### ChatGPT :\\nSTEP 1: First, we need to factorize the given equation. We can factorize x out of the\\nequation to get:\\nx(x + 3.0) = 0\\nSTEP 2: Now, we have two factors that can equal zero: x = 0 and x + 3.0 = 0. Solving for\\nx in each equation gives us:\\nx = 0 and x = -3.0\\nSTEP 3: Therefore, the roots of the given equation are 0 and -3.0.\\nROOTS = [0, -3.0]\\n### GPT-4 :\\nStep 1: Identify the equation\\nThe given equation is x2+ 3.0x= 0.\\nStep 2: Factor the equation\\nWe can factor the equation by taking out the common factor, which is x.\\nSo, x(x + 3.0) = 0.\\nStep 3: Find the roots\\nNow, we have two factors: x and (x + 3.0). To find the roots, we need to set each factor\\nequal to zero and solve for x.\\nFor the first factor, x:\\nx = 0\\nSo, root1 = 0.\\nFor the second factor, (x + 3.0):\\nx + 3.0 = 0\\nx = -3.0\\nSo, root2 = -3.0.\\nStep 4: Present the roots\\nThe roots of the equation x2+ 3.0x= 0are 0 and -3.0.\\nROOTS = [0, -3.0]\\nFigure 32: Case Study 12: Quadratic equation solving from the blog Exploring ChatGPT vs\\nopen-source models on slightly harder tasks\\n11.13 Meeting Transcript Processing\\n### System:\\nYou are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any\\nguidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer.\\n### Human:\\nYou will read a meeting transcript, then extract the relevant segments to answer the following\\nquestion:\\nQuestion: How does Steven feel about selling?\\nHere is a meeting transcript:\\n—-\\n46John: Alright, so we’re all here to discuss the offer we received from Microsoft to buy our\\nstartup. What are your thoughts on this?\\nLucy: Well, I think it’s a great opportunity for us. Microsoft is a huge company with a lot\\nof resources, and they could really help us take our product to the next level.\\nSteven: I agree with Lucy. Microsoft has a lot of experience in the tech industry, and they\\ncould provide us with the support we need to grow our business.\\nJohn: I see your point, but I’m a little hesitant about selling our startup. We’ve put a lot of\\ntime and effort into building this company, and I’m not sure if I’m ready to let it go just yet.\\nLucy: I understand where you’re coming from, John, but we have to think about the future\\nof our company. If we sell to Microsoft, we’ll have access to their resources and expertise,\\nwhich could help us grow our business even more.\\nSteven: Right, and let’s not forget about the financial benefits. Microsoft is offering us a lot\\nof money for our startup, which could help us invest in new projects and expand our team.\\nJohn: I see your point, but I still have some reservations. What if Microsoft changes our\\nproduct or our company culture? What if we lose control over our own business?\\nSteven: You know what, I hadn’t thought about this before, but maybe John is right. It\\nwould be a shame if our culture changed.\\nLucy: Those are valid concerns, but we can negotiate the terms of the deal to ensure that\\nwe retain some control over our company. And as for the product and culture, we can work\\nwith Microsoft to make sure that our vision is still intact.\\nJohn: But won’t we change just by virtue of being absorbed into a big company? I mean,\\nwe’re a small startup with a very specific culture. Microsoft is a huge corporation with a\\nvery different culture. I’m not sure if the two can coexist.\\nSteven: But John, didn’t we always plan on being acquired? Won’t this be a problem\\nwhenever?\\nLucy: Right\\nJohn: I just don’t want to lose what we’ve built here.\\nSteven: I share this concern too\\n—-\\nPlease answer the following question:\\nQuestion: How does Steven feel about selling?\\nExtract from the transcript the most relevant segments for the answer, and then answer the\\nquestion.\\n### Orca :\\nTo answer the question \"How does Steven feel about selling?\", we need to extract the\\nrelevant segments from the meeting transcript.\\n1. First, find the parts where Steven talks about selling:\\n- \"Steven: I agree with Lucy.\"\\n- \"Steven: Right, and let’s not forget about the financial benefits.\"\\n- \"Steven: But won’t we change just by virtue of being absorbed into a big company? I\\nmean, we’re a small startup with a very specific culture. Microsoft is a huge corporation\\nwith a very different culture. I’m not sure if the two can coexist.\"\\n- \"John, didn’t we always plan on being acquired? Won’t this be a problem whenever?\"\\n- \"Lucy: Right. I share this concern too.\"\\n2. Analyze Steven’s statements to understand his feelings about selling:\\n- Initially, Steven agrees with Lucy that selling to Microsoft is a great opportunity.\\n- He mentions the financial benefits of selling to Microsoft.\\n- Steven expresses concerns about the potential changes in the company culture and product.\\n- He acknowledges John’s concerns and shares them.\\n- Finally, he agrees with Lucy that they should consider the potential problems with selling.\\n3. Based on the analysis, Steven’s feelings about selling can be described as cautiously\\npositive. He sees the potential benefits but also has concerns about the company’s culture\\nand control over their own business.\\n### Vicuna :(does not provide supporting segments)\\nSteven feels hesitant about selling their startup. In the meeting transcript, Steven\\nagrees with Lucy that Microsoft could provide them with the support they need to\\ngrow their business, but also expresses concerns about losing control over their own\\nbusiness and the potential changes that could come with being absorbed into a big\\n47company. Steven also shares John’s concerns about losing what they’ve built at their startup.\\n### ChatGPT :(does not provide supporting segments)\\nSteven feels positively about selling. He agrees with Lucy that Microsoft could provide the\\nsupport they need to grow their business, and he also mentions the financial benefits of the\\ndeal. However, he later expresses concern about the potential changes to their company\\nculture if they are acquired by Microsoft.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nTo answer the question \"How does Steven feel about selling?\", we need to extract the\\nrelevant segments from the meeting transcript. Here are the key segments related to\\nSteven’s thoughts on selling:\\n1. Steven: I agree with Lucy. Microsoft has a lot of experience in the tech industry, and\\nthey could provide us with the support we need to grow our business.\\n2. Steven: Right, and let’s not forget about the financial benefits. Microsoft is offering us a\\nlot of money for our startup, which could help us invest in new projects and expand our\\nteam.\\n3. Steven: You know what, I hadn’t thought about this before, but maybe John is right. It\\nwould be a shame if our culture changed. 4. Steven: I share this concern too\\nNow, let’s use these segments to answer the question:\\nSteven initially feels positive about selling, as he agrees with Lucy about the potential\\nbenefits of Microsoft’s support and resources. He also mentions the financial benefits of the\\noffer. However, after hearing John’s concerns about the potential changes to the company\\nculture and losing control, Steven starts to have some reservations and shares John’s\\nconcerns. So, Steven’s feelings about selling are mixed, with both positive and negative\\naspects.\\nFigure 33: Case Study 13: Meeting transcript understanding from Exploring ChatGPT vs\\nopen-source models on slightly harder tasks\\n48References\\n[1]Wanjun Zhong, Ruixiang Cui, Yiduo Guo, Yaobo Liang, Shuai Lu, Yanlin Wang, Amin Saied,\\nWeizhu Chen, and Nan Duan.

      " The key takeaways from this research are that GPT-4 prefers longer responses over shorter ones, and has a bias in the order of the candidate responses. Additionally, the research suggests that auto-evaluation measures may overestimate the abilities of smaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and reasoning skills. Finally, the research proposes explanation tuning, which augments query-response pairs with detailed responses from GPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response.\n"
