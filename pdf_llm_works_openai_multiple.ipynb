Gandhi, the ‘great soul’ we know \\ntoday as the Mahatma. Look on these haiku as concentrated images that reﬂect the life and \\ntimes of a remarkable man who freed India from the stranglehold and shackles of Empire.\\nHaiku cannot tell the whole story. All you will ﬁnd here is a glimpse – an insight of such \\nintensity that, hopefully, you will be inspired to ﬁnd out more – about Gandhi, and about \\nyourself!\\nThe book you are holding in your hands was originally conceived as a work of photo-haiku, that is \\nto say, haiku responding to actual historical photos of Mahatma Gandhi. Then we had the \\nmuch better idea of asking a distinguished artist to come on board, Masood Hussain, and \\nto re-interpret the photos in his own captivating style.\\nIn turn, Masood’s artwork inspired new haiku and the book took shape in this lively fashion, \\nartwork and ideas ﬂowing from Ireland to Kashmir and back again – via our project  \\nco-ordinator in New York. So, it’s been around the world, you could say.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe creators of this book wish to thank a number of people who have provided in -\\nvaluable assistance in bringing this project to fruition, including Rosheen Callender, \\nEithne Ní Chléirigh, Des Geraghty, Dr. Siby K.

For others, independent thinkers, \\nGandhi was a new incarnation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and of Tolstoy, \\ndenouncing the illusions and the crimes of civilisation, and preaching to \\nmen the return to nature, to the simple life, to health.\\nRomain RollandWalk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n13is fada ag tnúth le do lámh iad…\\ngach gráinnín luachmhar\\nsalainn\\nhow they long for your hand…\\neach precious grain\\nof salt\\n!\\xa0One of the great events in India’s freedom struggle was the march to Dandi, a coastal town\\nin the Mahatma’s native state, Gujarat. There he and his followers gathered sea-salt,\\na commodity which was taxed by the British administration. (India under British rule was \\nknown as the Raj. Direct rule lasted from 1859 to 1947, the year before Gandhi’s death).  \\n Gandhi mar ched from his ashram – a spiritual retreat – on March 12, 1930, and \\nreached the shores of the Arabian Sea on April 5 where he and his followers helped \\nthemselves to some salt. It was a gesture that shook the Empire.  \\n Gandhi and his f ollowers had walked over 240 miles. Women and men were viciously \\nclubbed when they reached Dandi; yet none of them offered any resistance as they fell, \\nbleeding, to the ground.  \\n The Mahatma belie ved that ahimsa,  non-violence, was the key to emancipation, to \\npersonal and political freedom. Civil disobedience represented a moral force that would \\nshame the British Empire in the eyes of the civilised world. Civil disobedience inspired \\nother leaders, civil rights leaders in America and Northern Ireland, for instance, as well \\nas many student groups such as OTPOR in Belgrade.  \\n It is a tactic still used t oday by many people who campaign for various important \\nissues, such as maintaining biodiversity, creating a clean and safe environment,  \\nadvocating for peace, social justice and transparency and securing the survival of minority \\nlanguages.Walk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n15éanlaith na síthe\\nag dul trí thine…\\ndubhaíonn is deargann spéartha\\nbirds of peace\\ncatch fire…\\nskies redden and darken\\n!\\xa0The Mahatma (‘Great Soul’) went on fasts whenever rioting broke out in India. It pained him\\ngreatly to see people being dominated by others, whether on the basis of caste – one’s\\nposition in Hindu society – or religion. Yet there are many in India today who say he did not do  \\nenough to eradicate casteism or Varna. (Now some scholars say that casteism was not tradition- \\nally as virulent or divisive as we all thought it was: it came into its own as a result of the  \\ncolonisers’ interpretation of ancient texts).*\\n As a y oung man in South Africa, he once travelled ﬁrst class on a train and was told that a  \\nsammy – slang for an Indian (based on the word swami)  – had no right to travel ﬁrst class. Gandhi \\ninsisted that he had every right and was thrown off the train. At that moment he said to himself, \\n‘There’s too much bullying in this world.’ He would show, by example and by self-sacriﬁce, that \\nturning the other cheek is an effective way to help the bully to realise his shameful ways.\\n He achie ved much for the status of his fellow Indians in South Africa and learned strategies \\nthat he would employ on his return to India but native Africans – such as Zulus – do not hero- \\nworship Gandhi today. Au contraire! Gandhi took the side of the British in the Zulu uprising of \\n1906. History is strange: full of contradictions.\\n Though Gandhi did nothing f or native South Africans, concentrating his energy on the Indi -\\nan minority there, he was an inspiration to Mandela and the African National Congress. Never -\\ntheless, students and professors in a university in Ghana were agitated by a statue of Gandhi. \\nOne night, the statue disappeared! Only the plinth remained.\\n Public statues can be c ontroversial.

Empires often collapsed because they overex -\\ntended – they literally went too far! Something as simple as poisonous lead in the water \\nsystem may have contributed to the downfall of the Roman Empire. The British Empire \\nwas not the ﬁrst empire to rule India. Before the British, there was the Mughal Empire. \\nEverybody has their own theory about the collapse and who was to blame. One theory \\nsays it was all the fault of bankers.\\n By 1921, Gandhi was the l eading ﬁgure in the Indian National Congress and changed it \\nfrom being, mainly, a club for the Anglicised elite, mostly lawyers, into a beacon of hope \\nfor all.  \\n He ne ver lost an opportunity to preach Swaraj, in other words, complete independence \\nfrom Britain. He believed that a boycott of British institutions – and goods – would speed \\nthem all on the road to freedom. Bonﬁres blazed, burning British clothes; and schools \\nset up by the British were also boycotted.\\n The w ord boycott comes from Captain Charles Boycott who represented an absentee \\nlandlord, Lord Erne, in Co. Mayo. Captain Boycott was boycotted by the locals – even the \\npostman refused to show up with the mail! Boycotting was famously used again in Ireland \\nwhen oranges from South Africa were targeted in protest at the apartheid regime. It\\nremains an important non-violent weapon today.\\n Do you know of any other campaigns where this tactic has been – or continues to be – \\nused? How effective is the boycott as a weapon, compared to alternative forms of action?Walk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\ntagann éanlaith strae\\nis éisteann le do chuid smaointe…\\ndo thost\\nstray birds come\\nand listen to your thoughts…\\nyour silence\\n!\\xa0Stray Birds  is the name of a slim volume of short prose-poems by Rabindranath\\nTagore, a contemporary of Gandhi who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\\nIt is said that he wro te it after a visit to Japan where he c ame under the inﬂuence of haiku.  \\nIt was Tagore, incidentally, who gave Gandhi the name Mahatma (Great Soul), four years \\nafter his return to I ndia, and Gandhi re ferred to Tagore as  Gurudev (Supreme  Teacher).*\\n Silence, too, is a great teacher and sayin g nothing at all is a form of fasting.

Most people have one religion – or none – as an \\nearly inﬂuence in their lives but Gandhi’s father enjoyed religious discussions and \\nhad people in his house who would discuss a variety of religious experience, including \\nHinduism, Islam, Jainism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.\\n Fundamentally, all religions are the same. If someone says Namaste  to you it means, \\n‘I bow to the divine that is within you and within all of us.’\\n Strangely enough, it was while he was in London that Gandhi began to take a deep \\ninterest in his own religion. There he met such people as the Anglo-Irish activist Annie \\nBesant who would be remembered later not only as a champion of Indian and Irish \\nfreedom but also as a Theosophist, someone with an interest in the timeless truths of \\nall religions.\\n Among the pictures on the walls of his South African law ofﬁce was a picture of Jesus \\nand a picture of Annie Besant.\\n Later, Besant would oppose Gandhi’s ideas, believing them to be unrealistic. Gandhi’s \\nmass movement could only lead to violence and chaos, she believed; the non-resistance \\nshowed by the brave men and women in Dandi was inspiring, to be sure, but could never \\nbe replicated nationally on a grand scale. She was proven to be correct.Walk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n81pléascann siad fós\\nna hurchair úd, Bapuji…\\npléascann siad fós\\nthey still ring out\\nthose three shots, Bapuji…\\nthey still ring out\\n!\\xa0Bapu  means ‘father’ in many Indian languages, including Gandhi’s native language,\\nGujarati.\\n“ No living man has, either by precept or example, inﬂuenced so vast a number \\nof people in so direct and profound a way.\\nHarold LaskiWalk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n83an maitheann tú dod’ dhúnmharfóir é…\\nid’ chroí istigh\\nan aontaíonn tú leis?\\ndo you forgive your assassin…\\nand in your heart of hearts\\nagree with him?\\n!\\xa0Towards the end of his fruitful life, Gandhi began to doubt his own usefulness.\\n Was anyone listening to him anymore?

A symbol of traditional self-sufﬁciency. Spinning was a ritual\\nfor Gandhi and he often made his own clothes while in prison, encouraging others to\\ndo the same and not rely on clothes imported from Britain.\\nIn his ﬁnal y ears, he and his followers began the day with spinning – at four o’clock \\nin the morning! Spinning was a form of meditation: Gandhi disliked the way the slow \\nrhythms of work which we knew for thousands of years were disrupted by the so-called  \\nadvances of modern technology.\\n Was he right? Or is this what is called hypophysics? Hypophysics means everything \\nthat is natural is valuable in itself and what is unnatural must be avoided. Wear natural \\nclothes, eat natural foods and so on. That’s ﬁne.\\nBut is it natur al to take a ﬂight from Dublin to Delhi? \\nIs it natur al to undergo a heart transplant?\\nWas Gandhi a Luddite? The original Luddites smashed machinery because it was  \\nreplacing traditional arts and crafts.\\n If he w ere alive today, would Gandhi favour Neo-Luddism, or Anarcho-Primitivism, a \\nreturn to nature, a rejection of unbridled technology?Walk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n99tit go séimh\\nséimh ar a chorp…\\npeitil ó neamh\\nfall gently\\ngently on his corpse…\\npetals from heaven\\n!\\xa0It wasn’t a man called Godse who killed Gandhi. No, no, no! Not at all. According to a\\nwise Indian philosopher, Jiddu Krishnamurti, you killed him. I’m afraid so. Yes, you!\\nYou held the Beretta 9mm pistol in your hand and shot him three times. I killed him as \\nwell. We all killed him. As long as we see ourselves as divided, one from the other, we are \\npotentially very dangerous – deadly in fact.\\n In the c ourse of a public talk in Mumbai, shortly after Gandhiji’s death, Krishnamurti tried \\nto get this point across, reminding us of the fractured nature of humanity, our blindness \\nto the oneness and sacredness of us all. If you want a name for this philosophy, it’s Advaita  \\nor Non-duality. He said:\\n You are either a Hindu, a Parsee, a Buddhist, or a Mussulman – you know, the whole rot  \\nof identiﬁed division, isolation. So… you are responsible, aren’t you? You are the real \\ncause of this murder.\\nThis is classic Indian philosophy and it’s what Gandhi himself believed, seeing the Self in \\nall and all in the Self.Walk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n101breocharn…\\ndúinn go léir í\\ntine seo na híobartha\\nfuneral pyre…\\nthis sacrifice burns\\nfor us all\\n“Regarded simply as a politician, and compared with the other leading  \\npolitical ﬁgures of our time, how clean a smell he has managed to \\nleave behind!\\nGeorge OrwellWalk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n103ó, a Abhainn Yamuna\\nthugais leat a luaithreach…\\ncén áit cén áit?\\noh Yamuna River\\nyou have taken his ashes…\\nwhere oh where?\\n!\\xa0One of Gandhi’s biographers, Stanley Wolpert, gives us a stirring summary of the Mahatma’s\\ntrue nature and achievement:\\nBy re-creating himself, through the power of his passion, in the humble, vulnerable,\\nimage of India’s poorest starving naked millions, Gandhi could… call upon that unarmed \\nragged army, whose pain he mirrored and magniﬁed in his own naked body, to follow him \\nbarefoot.Walk with Gandhi\\nMahatma: The Early Years\\nGandhi is born in Porbandar, a coastal town in Gujarat, India, on October 2 1869. He attends \\nprimary school in 1876. Ancient Indian epics light up his imagination. Slight of stature, \\nGandhi is quite a nervous boy and hasn’t much aptitude for sports or studies. Does it \\nmatter? Not at all. It’s who you are in your heart and soul that really matters!\\nGandhi ﬁnds Truth and Courage in the old epics, just as many Irish people derive inspiration \\nfrom the beautiful poems and heroic tales of the Fiannaíocht: glaine ár gcroí /purity of \\nheart/ neart ár ngéag /strength of limb/ is beart de réir ár mbriathar /action to match our \\nwords.\\n(This was the mantra, by the way, on a banner in the home of the revolutionary Countess \\nMarkievicz; her home was looted by British soldiers and the banner, seen as a war trophy, \\nis now housed in the Imperial War Museum in London).\\nBack to Gandhi!\\nBy 1881 he’s in secondary school and still no wiser.\\nIn 1883, at the age of thirteen, he marries 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji (“Ba” for short). \\nHe’s still a fearful teenager and sleeps with the light on. But he is also entering the  \\nrebellious stage of youth and with every misdeed, he promises to himself, ‘Never again!’\\n104Bóthar na Saoirse\\n105His father dies in 1885 and a ﬁrst child is born to the young couple, Kasturbai and  \\nMohandas Gandhi. The child dies after a few days. The couple have four more children, all \\nsons.\\nOn September 4 1888, he goes to London to train as a barrister. He wants to ﬁt in, to become \\nan English gentleman, and so he gets elocution lessons!\\nIn London, he meets Theosophists, people searching for the truth behind all religions and \\nhis interest in his own religion, Hinduism, is ignited.\\nJainism was a religion which was strong in his home area of Western India and when \\nhe reads the New Testament and the teachings of Christ, he is struck by the similarity \\nbetween what Christ taught and the teachings of the founder of Jainism, Mahavira, who \\nsaid:\\n In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all creatures as we regard \\nour own self.\\nWhile in London, his political consciousness began to form as well:\\n …he came in touch with liberal and Christian ideas and the then novel teachings of \\nTolstoy about non-cooperation with evil and violence.\\nFreedom Fighters of India, M. G. Agrawal (Gyan Publishing House, 2008)\\nJune 12, 1891, the qualiﬁed barrister arrives in Bombay (Mumbai today) and hears the very \\nsad news that his mother has passed away.\\nHe cannot ﬁnd his feet as a lawyer and accepts a job in Natal, South Africa, then part of the \\nBritish Empire. Insult after insult await him there. In a Durban courthouse, a magistrate  \\norders him to remove his turban. He is ejected from a “whites only” carriage in a train;  \\nrefused entry in hotels; endures the violent language and behaviour of the ruling classes.\\nLet us be forever grateful to the oaf who threw Gandhi off the train in Maritzburg where \\nhe spent the night in a cold waiting-room. He has had enough! He emerges as a ﬁghter – a \\nﬁghter the likes we have never known before, armed only with truth, love, courage and \\nhumility. These qualities are in all of us, waiting to be born!\\nWhat happens to him next? Try the library!\\nWherever war and destruction occur today, whenever bullies, oafs and populists start \\nﬂexing their muscles, we can evoke the spirit of the Mahatma and ﬁnd our own path of \\ndigniﬁed protest and civil disobedience.Walk with Gandhi\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n107tost i lár na bhfothrach\\n…glórbhosca na bábóige\\nbriste\\nsilence amid ruins\\n…a doll’s voice box\\nbrokenTM\\nBóthar na Saoirse\\n109The creators of this book\\nMasood Hussain,  an accomplished draughtsman and proliﬁc watercolorist, honed his \\nformidable skills at Sir J.J.
