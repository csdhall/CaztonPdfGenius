[Music] we'll ask the legendary Bond investor Jeffrey gunlock about all of that he does join us right now exclusively to react the CEO CIO co-founder of double line Capital Jeffrey it's a pleasure to have you here on fed day as always yes judge it's going to be back for fed day not a lot of uh Josh is right not a lot of uh news today uh is almost a direct repeat of the last meeting you know carefully he said that very early on mhm repeated it I think the market likes carefully uh so stocks uh rallying bonds uh obviously rallying too we're down now about 25 basis points but also you know he said they're not even talking about cutting uh interest rates they're not even having a discussion about it and yet at the same time he's not confident that they're sufficiently restrictive so the door was left pretty much wide open for future flexibility at meetings and uh you know the yield curve is completely flat so it's uh kind of in the same mode uh I think that the fed's tone was the J P's tone was and that's a reason why you can rally after this brutal selloff in Long rates over the past uh 2 3 months I'm I'm I'm glad you went there because the you know the words may have been nearly identical the statement certainly as you said was nearly identical what's not identical to the last meeting is the move in interest rates 10year yield was 434 Jeffrey at the time of the last decision we've been talking about 5% certainly more recently closer to 4.9% though you see the drop having today um and he does acknowledge the the tighter Financial conditions existing and the impact that that is having uh overall so they clearly have been moved by the fact that the bond Market's done a lot of work for them I think that's right uh the higher for longer concept has a really dark underbelly to it that I think has affected the bond market over the past 6 or eight weeks and that is that the interest expense on our debt is going up by hundreds of billions of dollars and it goes up every day that the FED funds rate stays at 5 and 38% and if the fed's going to raise rates a little bit more which seems less certain than it was say per perhaps the less Dot Plot well then we're going to have a lot of interest expense in in fact 50% of the treasuries supply in the public treasuries mature in the next three years and so if rates stay at these levels we're going to have an interest expense that goes up to $2 trillion uh on the federal debt and that's what the deficit is today is about $2 trillion so we have this tremendous pressure caused by the FED staying higher for longer and I really think that the narrative is changing I see it almost on a day-to-day basis now that people are realizing that this interest expense problem is starting to come home very quickly in fact if we have a deficit that's 6% of GDP or 8% of GDP in that range which is the range we've been in we will have interest expense that will be 50% of tax receipts in 5 years and obviously that's a really big problem so one thing that the market is has to confront is we cannot sustain these interest rates and this deficit any longer in fact i' I've uh started to refer to our debt problem and interest sense problem using the nuclear uh defense condition the Defcon you know if you're at DEFCON 5 everything's fine but I think we're at Defcon 3 now and I think we're about to go to Defcon 2 on this situation because if you look at the debt clock. org website they show that we have 200 $11 trillion of unfunded liabilities in the United States and they also calculate that we have $219 trillion dollar of assets corporate assets household assets small business Assets in other words our unfunded liabilities are virtually identical to all of our assets and I just get this feeling that if the liabilities uh if the assets if the liabilities get bigger than the assets well that's kind of like you're running a hedge fund and you're about to get margin called it would mean that all of the obligations that we've made we can't even if we sold everything at today's prices we can just barely cover them right now it's almost like we're the equity holder back before the global financial crisis in a CDO squared type of financing scheme that ended up causing parts of the global financial crisis we need interest rates to come down or we need the deficit to come down and neither of those are happening with the FED higher for long and with these wars that we are intent on funding uh to I I hear the words blank check this is we're on a collision course with this Defcon going to Defcon 2 and I believe that we've started a bond rally here I think we've had such a a brutal increase I think the FED is sounding the right tone I do think rates are going to fall as we move into a recession in the first part of next year and I also think that based on our inflation model that the CPI is likely to come down on a headline basis anyway if we have the current commodity and energy structure in place which seems to be relatively stable it should come down to about 2 and a half% by say spring or early summer of next year so I think rates can fall in the backdrop of inflation being calm and the economy weakening rates can fall but then I think the response and this is my bigger picture view which is extremely important I think we're going to get we've started a bond rail but once the reaction comes to the the the recession we're going to have an absolute Defcon two maybe had a Defcon one situation on our interest expense because I think interest rates are going to start going up because of the inflationary response that will be put in place you know uh to to come back the next recession go ahead I'm sorry Jud no it's it's okay because you in some respects Echo the likes of the legendary investors stand ducken Miller who was on the network this morning who most recently said that he had um bought a a massive position in the 2-year and was talking about exactly the types of things that you're looking out the the the longer term charts of funding the deficit and his words were downright scary so he seems to be aligned with with your point of view and I'm going to come back to you and I'm going to come back to Stan in a moment but I want to get to Steve Leeman Jeffrey who's come out of the room um Steve the biggest surprise to you was what it's it's clear to everybody and he was explicit in his own words JP pal was um in this move in interest rates what the bond market has done that he doesn't have to do I mentioned where they were rates were on the last meeting 434 we've been talking 49 of late so that's had a dramatic impact hasn't it yeah it has Scott and and and I want to go back to what I said on your show at noon which is I thought there was a risk that chair Powell would use this meeting to redirect the market towards the possibility of another rate hike he chose I think not to he said there's still a bias to hike but he didn't sound incredibly excited about that bias he's seemed willing to sort of say you know what uh yeah we're still thinking about whether or not we ought to hike again so that's where the bias is but he didn't rely as he has in the past on the September forecast that called for an additional hike this year beyond what they've already done and I think it's really interesting um what uh uh Mr gunlock is saying right there because where we are right now on the 10e Scott is we've kind of wiped out the increase in yields that we had since the very important moment on October 17th when we had that really strong retail sales report so at least in the 10e that's gone and I think where we're at the idea that that Jeff is saying that this's possibility of a bond reality what what I think one of the things the bond market been waiting for is an all clear signal from the FED that at least there's not going to be additional hikes and we can get into Jeff's very interesting comments about whether or not the FED actually needs to cut because of the deficit reasons but I will say the FED will at first not do any of that stuff until it feels secure on inflation but that being said the idea that the uh uh Bond Market has rallied to this point where it doesn't have quite a green light but it's not like afraid of an instant or all of a sudden red light anymore it's really yellow going or green when it comes to getting a the go signal from the FED that at least there isn't this very strong bias to hike again I think that was an important um change in the chairish tone today even so Steve it it's striking to me that here we are some 18 months into this regime of hiking interest rates you know uh historic move right 525 basis points in in nearly 18 months and today the Fed chair is still unable to answer the question of whether they are sufficiently restrictive he can say they're restrictive which he did numerous times but he cannot say that they're sufficiently restrictive which to me is just incredible given what they've done in the reasonably short time that they've done it yeah I mean Scott they're trying to thread a needle here they're trying to do a get a soft Landing here not have a recession if they can get away with not having one um growth has been um way more resilient than any private sector or government sector uh Economist has forecast uh unemployment has remained lower than people had forecast the rebound from the pandemic has essentially defied most economic models and I think it's fair for to say you know what this is a very uncertain time what they're what he's trying to do is keep Jeff from being too happy he doesn't want to have a a a a a a bright green signal that you can go ahead and start buying that short end of the coupon curve there the two-year note to bring down I think he's let me just say this way Scott he's happy with the way the yield curve is right now in terms of the 10year being more restrictive but I don't think he wants to own it he doesn't want to be responsible for the tenure being here there or he's happy that it's more restrictive he doesn't want to necessarily get in the way of the market pricing it the way it's going to price it yeah appreciate that Steve thank you as always Steve Leeman senior economics reporter back to Jeffrey gunlock Jeff do you want to react uh to what Steve lean just told us yeah I think he's right on I mean I think that somehow the tone seems to have changed I feel like there's a good probability that in December when we get dot plots I have a feeling they're not going to be as aggressive as the current Dot Plot and I also think that the shape of the yield curve is extremely unstable at this point in time we have an absolute flat as a pancake yield curve we had that inverted yield curve of 108 basis points twos to 10 that's basically completely gone this is the classic action that one gets prior to recessions you get a yield curve that inverts and people talk a lot about it and I it's very inverted but it hangs out there for a long time one point that I've been trying to uh Mentor the young people people in the investment businesses everything takes much longer than you think it's going to the yield curve inverts and everybody says oh we're on recession watch no you're not it has to be inverted for like a year a year and a half but that's already happened and then it has to De invert and that is now happened we also have the unemployment rate while low it is now noticeably trending higher and it's above its 12 month moving average and it's about to go above its threeyear moving average in the first half of next year that's very recessionary we also have consumer confidence and uh and that has started to deteriorate in terms of people's view of the present and that's starting to close the gap between the always cautious view of the future and the view of the present these are very recessionary signals and so I really believe that layoffs are coming I think we've start we've seen Hours come down we've seen uh hiring freezes and now we're starting to see layoff uh announcements not on mass and not on but but they're they're they're out there in financial firms and Technology firms and I believe that's going to spread so I really believe that we're going to get this Bond rally I think the short end is going to come down and I I hope it h happens sooner rather than later because we we can't afford this government that we're running at today's interest rate level it's completely unsustainable and I always seem to agree with Stan um we seem to have that same sort of eore mentality about analyzing uh government's finances I mean you you've used words like exciting of late when talking about what it's like to be a bond investor that you can quote buy a t- bill and chill now you have liked the longer end at periods not that long ago right the 30-year but are you saying that the best the best way to play this now is to buy the short end uh I I think you can buy the entire yield curve at this point I think the belly will out will outperform I think the long end will do very well on a on a price basis but it might not have as many basis points of a decline but where the excitement really is in the bond market is in two and threeyear uh lived uh credit where we if we buy consumer receivables like credit card receivables or we buy uh certain commercial real estate say hotels and hospitality and Leisure forget about office we're talking about getting yields of 7 and a28 even 8 and a half% Without Really any concern about defaults because the short end is so high and you're pricing these on a spread above the two the 2-year treasury which is you know up up at 5% and so if you can get a spread of 200 bases points which is which is doable you're talking about yields of 8% with very very little risk and so as I've been talking about really for several months if not quarters the returns available on a risk adjusted basis in a mix of credit on the short end of the of the market and then you can sleep at night because you own some re Cession protection uh that will come in handy I think in the first half of next year by owning the long end so you have a a combination of things and so it's very easy to get yields uh if you go to close if you go to closed end funds which are now in a seasonally weak period because there's tax loss selling and so they're trading at substantial discounts net asset values you can get yields without a lot of risk of 12 133% in the closed end fund universe and because of rates having risen so much over the past nearly two years the prices of a lot of these credits that are in these closed in funds are down at 50 6070 cents on the dollar so even if you get a recession and you have defaults who cares if you buy a bond at par you've got to worry about credit defaults but if that Bond due to interest rate increases is trading at 65 cents on the dollar who cares if 30% of them default and return nothing in terms terms of recovery value you'll still get 70 on your cost of 65 so you're getting carry of double digits with very high probability of profits over a multi- quarter time frame I'm I'm almost hearing you also suggest I'm sorry to interrupt you Jeffrey that you know that the equity Market can do well in the reasonably near term because if rates are going to come down recession still pushed off far enough as you said things take a while to happen the Fed not go again anytime soon if at all do you have a view on the equity Market well I I've I've been negative uh on the equity market for SE several months but just a just a couple of days ago I observed that the S&P 500 has fallen all the way down to its trend line from the low in 2020 up through through through the low uh between now and then if you just connect those those those low points and the that's S&P 500 came down and met that trend line this week and we're sitting right on it so with this relaxation in bond yields which is obviously been a problem for the stock market and this trade location on the S&P 500 I certainly think that this would be a poor trade location to be a seller interesting Josh Brown sitting next to me uh has to advise his clients on what the best strategies are he has a question for you Jeffrey hey Jeff thanks so much for all your commentary today I appreciate it um wanted to ask you given that in the post pandemic period so many surprising things have happened so many outcomes that nobody could have predicted because of how unique this environment is what if hire for longer ends up serving actually as stimulus for the 20% of wealthy households that are now earning tons of money on their cash don't really care what a mortgage rate is because they own their home is that a situation where the wealthy continue to spend thereby negating what would normally happen with higher for longer and one other thing to throw into the mix if unemployment rate starts to climb as you suggest couldn't that also perversely be stimulative think about how great that would be for all of the employers who have been dying based on all of these salary increases and minimum wage hikes isn't it couldn't we have this situation where actually higher for longer is better higher unemployment is healthier and actually that ends up prolonging the economic cycle and not it I don't know Josh I mean there's some logic to that I I I think that the wealthy people they save they have savings they have wealth by definition and so them getting a higher interest rate of you know 6% instead of 2% I'm not really sure that motivates spending exactly I I think it just makes them wealthier uh so I I I don't I don't really know about that I just think that all of those unusual things that happened that you correctly point out I think when you Dro $4.5 trillion dollars of free money into an economy one should not be uh one should not be careful about uh predicting that's going to have outsized consequences so what I think everybody missed here is what we had initially with all that stimulus was a massive boom in consumption of durables and and that sort of the manufacturing part of the economy and then what people missed is it then turned into a Services economy because there was all this P up demand for services and travel and Leisure and all that stuff and I feel like that's wearing off at this point in time uh and so I I'm not really sure that that that those conditions are going to endure much longer and I I I again I say higher for longer I'm going to go back to my number one point that I started this segment on and that is higher for longer means we have a massive interest expense problem a massive interest expense problem in this country that is going to be I believe the next financial crisis and so that's what I'm more focused on rather than some some you know Scrooge McDuck having more money in his vault what about the idea of cash being King I've had people come on you know the network this week and suggest that that is actually the best place to be that's where the lowest amount of risk is right now what amount of cash would you have in a portfolio now I I don't like cash because I think that your interest rate which is very attractive presently made decline quite substantially next year so I would rather be in something that's about two to three years so at least you're getting that yield that I talked about around 8% at least you're going to get that for more than 6 months t- Bill and chill you can buy the six-month T Bill and get five and a half and spend that way for a long time now the rate is no longer going higher it's now starting to potentially decline so I don't think you want to be in cash the the the shape of the yur suggests that the uh 2024 will see the FED cut rates by about 50 or maybe 60 6 50 basis points or maybe 58 of a percent that's the one thing that I think will not happen I think that e either there are going to be rates will stay high for longer which is not my base case but I acknowledge that's a possibility but if the economy rolls over as I expect the FED is not going to cut rates 50 basis points they're going to cut rates 200 basis points and that's what's wrong with the cash strategy you know the other thing I heard that Chair say today that that I frankly don't recall him saying certainly not at a at a meeting was when he was addressing the idea of what the backup in rates has done where Financial conditions have gone he said they're attentive to all of that he did mention a stronger dollar being an influence on future rate decisions and you know what else he said Jeffrey which sort of struck me at that moment lower Equity prices he actually brought that into the mix today as being a thing that could influence their future rate decisions that if something happened in the stock market that could be a powerful influence for the FED what's your take on that well what what's new here I mean that's always the case remember 2018 where we had that bare Market in the fourth quarter of 2018 because the FED said that they were on autopilot for raising rates and doing quantitative tightening and the stock market dropped 20% in like four four or five weeks the the the junk bond market seized up there was no issuance for weeks on end and suddenly the FED started cutting and abandon all of their rhetoric so I believe deeply that when the recession comes you're going to see a bond rally it maybe company with a stock rally initially but they're going to reverse because of the policies and then we'll see what happens when the stock market starts to drop in Earnest with what would be surprisingly potentially a weak economy with Rising bond yields after their initial decline you also talked about oil prices being a quote real problem um that they would perhaps influence um more hawkish the FED to react if they you know obviously took off higher are you surprised by the stability in oil prices even as we have a major war in the Middle East I I think everyone should be surprised that oil prices are down near 80 uh you would think that there would be significant uh you know shock problems with that that that war danger and it's obviously going to be expanding but I think what you're seeing is the demand just isn't really that strong uh Europe isn't doing all that well the oil prices are down because the economy is slowing down and so I I do think that's a wild card oil could very definitely go higher on the wrong outcome in the Middle East but for now the commodi complex is completely asleep uh oil oil included where the the Bloomberg commodity index continues to gently drift lower still below its 200 day moving average which continues to decline so that's just another indicator I think of of less economic uh strength than we saw say in the in the the GDP number that just came out with a four handle I noticed that GDP now today from the Atlanta Fed was cut from 2.3% to 1.2% for the current quarter because of the very bad ISM report that came out today that I think really is a further corroboration of this economic uh slowdown that I think is is going to be building steam in the months ahead so let's look at the tenure Before I Let You Go as we have this conversation here 475 is where we are um given your economic projection what you think happens going forward with the FED let's you know if you think they're done the end of next year do we have a a two- handle on the 10-year uh the three handle two handle what is the 10 year at the end of next year do you think uh that's that's way too far out to forecast but I'm going to say that the 10year treasury will probably be not terribly different from where it is today at the end of next year I think it I think we'll go into a two-handle first but then it's going to start Rising so this is this is an active uh situation so for now bonds I think are in a good spot I think the tenure will see below 450 before we see above 5% and the tenure treasury has not closed above 5% uh in this cycle uh it's it was right on it but never closed above it I I think we're headed to in the lower fours before we head back up to where we are or a little bit higher than we are today at the end of next year but don't hold me to that judge i' I I I have to deal with the next two months here to get close out this year before I worried about 2024 you know I was going to preface that question with I know you hate this question but we love the question but I didn't feel like saying that even though I knew you hated it but it is what it is I may ask you again sometime but you know we're all good I appreciate you Jo I appreciate you joining us as always Jeffrey exclusively here on closing bell right after the FED share finishes we'll see you next meeting you beta one more to go for 2023 good luck everybody yep you as well that's Jeffrey gunlock of double line
