[Music] the indian military hasn't always been able to satisfy its needs using domestically produced weapons and equipment now however the tajes tajes-like combat aircraft is attracting attention from outside of india india has now given the go-ahead for the tajius mark ii project to be built not only is the tajes mark ii aircraft more potent than the current mark 1 but its offensive systems are also state of the art it will be more durable have a shorter weapon reload time a higher likelihood of survival and a better electronic warfare suit and radar as it can attack both in the air and on the ground this plane deserves the title pride of india a variety of technologies including as fly-by-wire avionics composites and more have been demonstrated aboard tajius mark 1. the new project will upscale those into a bigger and more powerful fighter six or more tajes mark ii squadrons between 110 and 120 aircraft are expected to be inducted into the indian air force the indian air force urgently needs taijus planes to increase the size of its fighter squadrons which now stands at 32 but needs to be at least 42 to counter the collusive danger posed by china and pakistan the development and production of an aircraft is a significant accomplishment for any nation it denotes exceptional scientific engineering and industrial capabilities and only a few nations have this capability but the aircraft has experienced numerous delays due to poor work culture in the drdo and the state-owned defense industry which has resulted in excessive delays and exorbitant cost increases however the drdo has performed well in recent years notably in terms of developing a range of tactical and strategic missiles that include cutting-edge technology and this accomplishment is noteworthy but the lesson from tajius is that this work culture must change tejas current history begins with the cag report of 2015 which said that the tagis mk-1 has a number of issues including being an underpowered aircraft lacking training capabilities lacking ew electronic warfare capabilities and lacking internal fuel capacity there were problems with both the radar warning receiver and the countermeasure dispensing system now these hurdles are not anything that could be called ordinary consequently in order to cope with these issues it is absolutely required to entirely redesign the aircraft however later on hindustan aeronautics limited the defence research and development organization and the aeronautical development agency recommended an upgraded version of the tajius aircraft the tajius mk1a in which certain flaws were corrected but the design was identical to the tagis mk1 the problems that were occurring with the radar warning receiver and the countermeasure dispensing system have been fixed in the mk1a variant and the podded active jammer will be installed in order to fulfill the ecm requirements of the iaf according to the defense research and development organization the mk-1a variant will be equipped with an indigenously built active electronically scanned array radar called utem that is capable of tracking 50 targets in the sky at a range of more than 100 kilometers and engaging approximately four of them at the same time however even here kag immediately went on to the conclusion and declared that even the tajes mk-1a is weak in performance and is not up to the standard of the iaf however the iaf has ignored all such reports and clearance granted by government on the 13th of january 2021 and an order of 83 tages mk1a was placed closing all these reports and making this deal india's largest indigenous procurement costing more than rupees 48 000 crores and the total inventory of tagis now in iaf would be 123 units however in this video we will analyze taj's mk-2 the future backbone and the next super warrior of the indian air force so let us look at the details of the tages mark ii project on wednesday the cabinet committee on security ccs chaired by prime minister modi approved the taj's mark ii project a more capable version of the indigenous tajes like combat aircraft the committee approved ten thousand crawl rupees for the design and development of the tajius mark ii fighter aircraft including prototypes flight testing and certification the mk2 would also have a more powerful engine the tajes mark 2 is said to be a more powerful variant of india's tagis multi-role combat aircraft the mark ii also known as the medium weight fighter is a single engine multi-role supersonic fighter produced by the state-owned hindustan aeronautics limited mark ii will not only have 70 indigenization it will also integrate more sophisticated technology that will be manufactured in india the jet will be fitted with more powerful ge414 engines providing it a larger combat range and weapon payload than the current tajes mark 1 that have ge-404 engines the aircraft also has a modern appearance the tajius mk-2 would be an advanced 4.5 plus plus generation aircraft that would be equal to and in many cases superior to the rafale it would also share some properties of the world's most advanced aircrafts such as the f-22 raptors indium oxide layer and optionally manned cockpit among other things a canard has been inserted forward of the wings evoking images of modern fighters such as the raphael eurofighter and sukhoi 30 mki the canard adds another control surface that forms a vortex boosting the aircraft's lifting capabilities and agility mark ii will also have superior radar avionics and electronics as well as the ability to carry a larger weapons payload it has been reported that the jet will carry the indigenous astra mark 1 and mark ii missiles additionally it would be equipped to carry rudramante radiation missiles apart from the weapon payload and engine the tajes mark 2's internals would be reorganized to make it more accessible and maintenance friendly because the aircraft is a medium weight fighter it is simple to maintain and is unlikely to encounter any maintenance difficulties the most intriguing aspect of any aeroplane is its weapon package tages will be armed with weapons like the scalp crystal maze and spice 2000 also it will be armed with brahmos astra rudrum missiles for air-to-air combat to ensure that it is capable of accomplishing anything in an aerial dogfight the tajes mk2 will be guided by the made in india uttam aesa radar according to reports this indigenous radar is sufficiently advanced to provide a competitive edge over the israeli-made radars installed on earlier tagis models uttam aesa radar can also identify and foil adversarial efforts at electronic warfare making the fighter plane far more capable of engaging in battle the mk-2 will be the foundation and backbone of the indian air force in the future and based on its specifications it may also become the most modern aircraft of air forces worldwide why the tajes mark ii is important the iaf has been looking for a perfect medium weight fighter for decades to replace the aging fleet of jaguars mig-29s and mirage 2000s to some degree the raphael fills this need but because to their cost they are almost difficult to operate in significant numbers after realizing it could no longer rely on imported fighter planes india opted to create its own more lethal version of the french rafale when can we expect the new jets according to ada officials the government has approved the production of prototypes the first of which is expected to be released within a year and the project is expected to be finished by 2027 after extensive flight trials and other associated work as a result we may anticipate the first tagis mk2 deployment in 2023 and the maiden flight in 2024 the tajus mk2 might be a good alternative for outdated war machines like the mirage 2000 and jaguars especially as it is being produced domestically with a significant indigenous content this aircraft together with the lca tajus mk1a the amca raphaels and su-30mki will strengthen india's air force [Music] you
