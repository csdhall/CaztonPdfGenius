THIS YEAR IS STILL HIS BASE  CASE LET'S TALK TO THE MAN HIMSELF. OUR BIG INTERVIEW OF THE MORNING. JAMIE DIMON. CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF JPMORGAN CHASE. HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THEN AND NOW >> BASICALLY NOTHING PART OF THE STORM CLOUD HIT. RATES WENT HIGHER THAN PEOPLE  THOUGHT. STOCK MARKET DOWN 20%. IPO MARKET DISAPPEARED THE ECONOMY, OF COURSE, WE ALL TALK ABOUT IT. IT IS LIKE THE WEATHER I HATE GUESSING ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HUMILITY. THE REAL ISSUE FOR THE WORLD IS  RUSSIA AND WAR AND UKRAINE AND ENERGY AND TRADE HOPEFULLY IT WILL MITIGATE AND GO AWAY. AS A RISK MANAGER, YOU HAVE TO PREPARE. >> WE WERE DEBATING WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IN TERMS OF THE MARKETS. >> THE MARKETS HAVE BEEN WRONG,  TOO. >> FOR A WHILE >> THE WAY WE RUN THE COMPANY IS TO SERVE CLIENTS DAY IN AND DAY  OUT THROUGH THICK OR THIN. I KNOW THERE WILL BE RECESSIONS. I DON'T SPEND THAT MUCH TIME WORRYING ABOUT IT. I WORRY ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY THAT DAMAGES AMERICAN GROWTH. NOT ABOUT WHAT THE WEATHER IS  LIKE I DON'T WANT A RECESSION IT HURTS AVERAGE AMERICANS I'M NOT FOR IT, BUT I HAVE TO  PREPARE FOR IT >> THERE ARE BUSINESSES HERE AND IF THEY NEED TO RAISE MORE CAPITAL AND IF THEY HAVE TO CALL YOU FOR THAT WHAT ARE YOU TELLING THEM? >> I THINK ANY BUSINESS, LARGE OR SMALL, SHOULD PREPARE FOR A BUNCH OF EVENTUALITIES AND RUN THE BUSINESS AND SERVE THE CLIENTS. NOT WORRY ABOUT PROFIT MARGINS ARE YOU BUILDING PRODUCTS AND  SERVICES CAN YOU HANDLE INPUT AND OUTPUT? >> A GLOBAL CONFLICT WOULD BE  BAD FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND FOR ALL OF US. WE'RE IN DAVOS IT IS LIKE THE RUSSIA PROBLEM  AND PEOPLE HAVE ON THE BACK  BURNER OH, YEAH DICTATORS WILL DO WHAT DICTATORS WILL DO. WE STILL HAVE HOW MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS? RUSSIA HAS HOW MANY NUCLEAR  WEAPONS? WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. >> I AGREE >> FOR EVERY PANEL ON CLIMATE  CHANGE, THERE ISN'T A PANEL. >> THE ONLY REAL FUTURE IS HOW THIS PLAYS OUT THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE AND I READ  KILLING KIDS AND BLACKMAIL. THIS COULD BE AN INFLECTION  POINT FOR THE WESTERN WORLD FOR  YEARS. DO WE GET OUR ACT TOGETHER TO  HELP UKRAINE AND NEGOTIATE TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA THAT IS THE ISSUE. THE OTHER STUFF IS THE WEATHER >> DO YOU LIKE AT THIS AS A  DRESS REHEARSAL FOR WHATEVER OUR RELATIONSHIP IS WITH CHINA IN  THE FUTURE >> AMERICANS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND  $75,000 GDP PER PERSON THEY IMPORT 11 TMILLION BARRELS  DAY. I WANT THEM TO DO WELL FOR THE PEOPLE WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE  RELATIONSHIP IT IS NOT ADVERSARY. I'M VERY HAPPY WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW >> THEY SAY THEY ARE OPENING UP. THAT IS THE MESSAGE YOU HEAR IN  DAVOS. IS THAT A HEAD FAKE? IS IT REAL >> THEY HAVE TO. >> FOR THE LONG TERM >> FOR THEMSELVES. THEY NEED TO GROW THEIR ECONOMY  AND LIFT UP THEIR PEOPLE AND C COMPETE IN THE WORLD THE WARM UP TO THE EXTENT THE  WESTERN WORLD -- TRADE WILL NOT  GO AWAY. IT WILL BE RESTRUCTURING OF TWO  TYPES. ANYTHING RELATING TO NATIONAL  SECURITY IT IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERY  COUNTRY. SEMICONDUCTORS SECURE, SAFE, CHEAP ENERGY AND FOOD THEN WE THINK UNFA
